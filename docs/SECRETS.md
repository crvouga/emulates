# Secrets runbook

Where every credential lives, who needs it, and how to run live parity without ever holding a sandbox key: GitHub Actions repo secrets are the only secret store.

There is no self-hosted secret store and no remote build cache to log in to. A fresh clone needs
nothing but Bun:

```bash
bun run setup   # install, build, create .env.local from .env.example
bun test        # no secrets
bun run check   # every CI gate, no secrets
```

Secrets are only involved in three places, and all three run on GitHub with the repo's own
Actions secrets. Anyone with **write access** to `crvouga/mockingbird` can use them without
seeing a value (GitHub never returns a secret's value, to anyone):

| Workflow | Secrets it reads | How to run it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Parity](../.github/workflows/parity.yml) | the `<SERVICE>_*` keys its live-parity step maps | `bun run parity:remote -- <service…>`, `-- --all` or `-- --tier=warm`; by [tier](TESTING.md#parity-tiers) also on each PR that changes a hot service ([Advisory](../.github/workflows/advisory.yml), non-blocking, not for forks) and weekly for warm services |
| [Verify](../.github/workflows/verify.yml) | `JUNCTION_API_KEY` | daily, or `gh workflow run verify.yml` |
| [Release](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | `NPM_TOKEN` (new packages only) | automatic on merge to `main` |

## Live parity

Each service's `scripts/parity.ts` loads its sandbox credentials from the environment through
[`@crvouga/mockingbird-credentials`](../packages/auth/credentials). The env var names start
with the service's name (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `JUNCTION_API_KEY`), and the GitHub Actions secret
has the same name.

**On GitHub (no keys needed).** Push your branch, then:

```bash
bun run parity:remote -- stripe            # one or more services
bun run parity:remote -- --all             # every service with a parity script
bun run parity:remote -- --tier=warm       # every service in a tier
```

This dispatches the Parity workflow on your branch, which passes the sandbox keys its live-parity
step maps to the run, and streams the log to your terminal. Needs `gh auth login`. The workflow
also uploads each service's `corpus/` directory as the `parity-corpus` artifact
(`gh run download <run-id> -n parity-corpus`), so a live recording can be committed.

**Locally (your own keys).** Put sandbox keys in `.env.local` (gitignored, loaded by Bun
automatically; `.env.example` lists every name, grouped by service), then:

```bash
bun run parity:service -- stripe twilio
bun run parity:stripe                      # the turbo shortcuts work too
```

A parity script exits 2 when its credentials are missing, and `parity:service` reports that as
"no credentials", never as a pass.

**Which services are configured?**

```bash
bun run secrets:doctor
```

This prints, per service, whether every key it needs is set as a repo secret (runnable with
`parity:remote`) and in your `.env.local`. It never prints values.

### Adding or rotating a sandbox key

`bun run secrets` is a small CLI over the repo secrets. It sends values to `gh secret set` over
stdin, so they never appear in output or on a command line:

```bash
bun run secrets                            # status: set / missing per service, on GitHub and locally
bun run secrets fill stripe                # prompt (hidden) for each missing key; Enter skips one
bun run secrets fill                       # ...for every service
bun run secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY          # prompt for one value (rotate)
bun run secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY --from-env   # take it from .env.local
bun run secrets rm STRIPE_OLD_KEY --yes
```

To upload everything you have set in `.env.local` at once:

```bash
bun run secrets push -- --dry-run          # which secrets would be set (= secrets:push)
bun run secrets push -- --yes
```

A service's secrets are the fields its parity script loads plus the names `.env.example` lists
under the service's heading; `secrets:doctor` and `secrets:push` read both. The Parity workflow needs one line per secret in the `env:` of its
live-parity step (`STRIPE_X: ${{ secrets.STRIPE_X }}`). It maps each secret by name
because GitHub holds a run that dumps the whole `secrets` context as "may be malicious" until
someone approves it by hand.

## Resolving issues on GitHub

`bun github:resolve-issues` runs the [Resolve issues](../.github/workflows/resolve-issues.yml)
workflow as **you**, with credentials bounded to that run. No repo secret is involved. The workflow
starts one Claude Code agent per `agent-reported` issue. Each agent opens a draft PR, runs
[`/resolve-issues <n>`](../.agents/commands/resolve-issues.md), and then runs `/pr-ready` until the
PR is green and ready to merge. When a decision needs a human, the agent comments on the issue
instead. It never merges.

```bash
bun github:resolve-issues setup           # once, by the repo owner (below)
bun github:resolve-issues                 # the queue: up to 3 (--max=<k>, at most 10) unassigned parity, bug, then feature issues
bun github:resolve-issues 190 191         # these issues (a new-service issue runs only when named)
bun github:resolve-issues --dry-run 190   # hand over and check the credentials, then stop
```

### Safeguards

- **You confirm each run.** The command shows the issues, model and ref, and asks before it
  creates anything (`--yes` skips the prompt). You then approve the run's GitHub token in the
  browser.
- **The GitHub token is minted per run and reaches this repo only.** GitHub has no API that
  creates a personal access token. So the command mints a GitHub App user access token with the
  device flow, from the repo's own app:
  - The app is installed on this repository alone.
  - It has only Contents, Issues, Pull requests and Actions write, and Checks and Statuses read.
    It has no Workflows, Administration, Secrets or Variables permission.
  - The token expires within 8 hours, and commits and PRs made with it are yours, so they
    trigger CI.

  The command refuses a token that reaches more, or that does not expire, and the job checks it
  again before using it (`scripts/github-app-token.ts`). So an agent misled by an issue's text
  cannot reach your other repositories, change a workflow file, or push to `main` (the ruleset
  also blocks that). Your `gh` login is used only on your machine, to dispatch the run and pass
  the credentials over.
- **Claude access is subscription-only.** `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` comes from your `.env.local`
  (`claude setup-token`). The job unsets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and Claude Code keeps its
  credentials out of the agent's shell commands (`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB`).
- **Credentials are never workflow inputs.** The repository is public, and inputs are neither
  masked nor secret. Instead, each job generates a key pair and uploads only its public key. The
  command encrypts the credentials to that key, bound to the run and the issue, and passes the
  ciphertext through a secret gist. It deletes the gist as soon as every job has read it; keep the
  command running until it says so, which takes a minute or two. The job masks both tokens,
  refuses anything that is not a one-line token, deletes its private key, and redacts both tokens
  from the agent's report. A re-run job cannot get credentials, so dispatch again instead.
- **Runs are bounded.** A run takes at most 10 issues, and each job stops after 3 hours. The job
  holds no vendor sandbox keys: to check a report against the oracle, the agent dispatches the
  Parity workflow (`bun run parity:remote`).

To cut a run's token off before it expires, revoke the app's authorization at
https://github.com/settings/apps/authorizations.

### One-time setup (repo owner)

```bash
bun github:resolve-issues setup
```

1. It opens a localhost page that registers the app on GitHub from a manifest. The app is
   private, has no webhook, and has only the permissions above. The command keeps only the app's
   public client id and slug, in `.github/resolve-issues-app.json`. The app's private key and
   client secret are dropped unread, so nothing can ever act as the app itself.
2. In the app's settings, tick **Enable Device Flow**, and keep **Expire user authorization
   tokens** on. Install the app on **Only select repositories** and pick this repository. The
   command prints both links.
3. Run `bun github:resolve-issues setup` again. It mints a token and checks all of the above.
   Then commit `.github/resolve-issues-app.json`.

## Releasing

The mock services (`@crvouga/mockingbird-service-*`, the only published packages) are released
automatically on every green push to `main` (see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)) and publish with
**npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC)**, which needs no stored credential.

OIDC can only publish to packages that already exist on npm and trust this repo. For brand-new
packages the release job uses the `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret:

- **Automatic release.** A granular npm token with read+write on the `@crvouga` scope is stored as
  `NPM_TOKEN`. CI creates missing packages, then runs `npm trust github` so later releases use
  OIDC. A scheduled run every six hours retries interrupted releases.
- **Setting the token.** `bun run release:bootstrap` prompts for it without echo, validates it with
  npm, stores it with `gh secret set`, then runs and watches CI on `main`. `-- --replace` rotates it.
- **Local fallback.** `bun run release:seed` (`-- --dry-run` to preview) runs `npm login` if
  needed, builds `origin/main` in a temporary worktree and runs `release:publish --local` there:
  it publishes with your npm login, pushes the tags and GitHub Releases, attaches the Trusted
  Publishers and deprecates every package no longer published.

```bash
bun run release:plan                       # what the next release would publish
bun run release:publish -- --dry-run
```

### Trusted Publisher settings

Set automatically by the release job when it has npm account credentials. Manual equivalent, per
package at `https://www.npmjs.com/package/<name>/access`:

- Organization/user: `crvouga`
- Repository: `mockingbird`
- Workflow filename: `ci.yml`
- Environment: (empty)

## Build cache

Turborepo uses its local cache (`.turbo/cache`) on your machine. In CI,
[`.github/actions/setup`](../.github/actions/setup/action.yml) keeps that same directory in the
GitHub Actions cache, one entry per CI job, warmed by every push to `main`, so pull requests replay
what `main` already built and tested. No token, no server.

## What exists where

| Credential | Where | Needed for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm Trusted Publisher (OIDC) | each package on npm | CI publish (attached automatically) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | built into GitHub Actions | automatic |
| `NPM_TOKEN` | repo secret | creating new packages, deprecations |
| `<SERVICE>_*` sandbox keys | repo secrets (+ optionally your `.env.local`) | live parity only |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | your `.env.local` (never a repo secret) | `bun github:resolve-issues`: your Claude subscription |
| Resolve issues GitHub App | its public client id in `.github/resolve-issues-app.json`; no private key or client secret is kept | `bun github:resolve-issues`: mints a token per run for this repo only (`setup` creates it) |
| `GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY` | your `.env.local` | optional: `pr:ready guardian ignore` |

Inventory: [`secrets.manifest.yaml`](../secrets.manifest.yaml) (non-parity secrets and the
Trusted Publishing checklist) and [`.env.example`](../.env.example) (every local name).
