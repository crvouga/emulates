# Developing Mockingbird

Working on this repo: requirements, how the packages are layered, and the quality gates every change passes.

## Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ 22** or **Bun ≥ 1.2** (ESM only).
- npm is required for the package-integrity gates (`bunx publint`, `bunx attw`); Bun runs the rest.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crvouga/mockingbird.git && cd mockingbird
bun run setup   # install, build every package, create .env.local from .env.example
bun test
```

That is the whole onboarding: no secrets, no accounts, nothing self-hosted. `bun run setup` is idempotent and uses [workspaces](https://bun.sh/docs/install/workspaces) + [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/overview). Live parity against the real sandboxes needs keys, but they are GitHub Actions secrets: with write access to the repo, `bun run parity:remote -- <service>` runs it on GitHub without you ever holding one ([docs/SECRETS.md](SECRETS.md)). A git hook lints commit messages on the spot — see [Quality gates](#quality-gates).

## Packages

**Naming (hard rule):** every package is `@crvouga/mockingbird-<kebab-case>`; the short names below drop that prefix. `bun run check:boundaries` fails CI on any other name.

**Publishing (hard rule):** only mock services (`service-<name>`) are published. Every other package is `"private": true`; a service that uses them builds with [`scripts/bundle-service.ts`](../scripts/bundle-service.ts), which inlines them (JavaScript and `.d.ts`) so the tarball needs nothing unpublished. `bun run check:boundaries` fails CI on a public non-service package.

| Layer | Packages | Published |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Services | `service-stripe`, `service-junction`, `service-genebygene`, `service-medplum`, `service-postgres`, `service-sqlite`, and every vendor mock in the [catalog](../README.md#services) | yes |
| Core | `core` (`FetchAPI`), `service` (Hono dispatch keyed by `operationId`) | bundled |
| Storage | `sqlite` (`SqliteClient` port, migrate runner, default `@crvouga/mockingbird-service-sqlite`) | bundled |
| Contract | `openapi`, `openapi-metadata`, `openapi-arbitrary`, `openapi-codegen` | bundled / build tool |
| Parity | `commands`, `model`, `canonicalize`, `parity` (runner) | bundled / tests |
| Adapters | `adapter-node`, `adapter-bun` | tests only |
| Auth | `credentials` (sandbox credentials for live parity, from the environment) | tests only |

## Quality gates

Every merge-blocking check is a single command you can run locally. `bun run check` runs the whole turbo graph; `bun run check:full` replicates the pull-request gate end-to-end (install + commitlint + check). Passing that gate is the release decision.

CI runs the same turbo graph as `bun run check`, spread over parallel runners ([`scripts/ci-plan.ts`](../scripts/ci-plan.ts) splits it and fails if the split drifts from the `check` script): a **Static** job (format, lint, boundaries, generated-file drift) and four **Shard** jobs, each running build, typecheck, test, pack and portability for a quarter of the packages. **Consumer smoke** runs beside them. A **Changes** job reads Turborepo's dependency graph ([`scripts/affected.ts`](../scripts/affected.ts)) and hands each Shard only the packages a change reaches: each changed package plus everything that depends on it, transitively. A change to one mock runs that mock and its dependents, never an unrelated mock; a change to a shared package runs every dependent. A file that belongs to no package runs everything unless it is on a list of paths the shards do not read (agent docs, worktree config, other workflows), and a `bun.lock` change reaches only the workspaces whose own entry changed (everything, if an external package or the root moved). Inside the affected packages, turbo's content hashes replay whatever did not change. The required **Check** job passes when every job the change needed passed.

The GitHub Actions cache is the remote cache ([`.github/actions/setup`](../.github/actions/setup/action.yml)); there is no turbo token or server. The CI workflow also runs on every push to `main`, so `main` holds a warm turbo cache per job and a PR's first run replays everything it did not change. Each job saves only the task hashes it used, `node_modules` is cached from `main` only, and [`cache-cleanup.yml`](../.github/workflows/cache-cleanup.yml) deletes a PR's caches when it closes and trims `main`'s daily. Locally turbo uses the same cache directory on disk.

Non-blocking checks live in [`advisory.yml`](../.github/workflows/advisory.yml): Biome findings as inline annotations, and live parity (the [Parity](../.github/workflows/parity.yml) workflow) for each **hot** service whose dependency graph the PR changes (see [Parity tiers](TESTING.md#parity-tiers)). They depend on live vendors or only restate the blocking lint, so a red advisory check informs the PR without holding its merge.

```bash
bun run setup          # first time: install + build
bun run check          # every gate below, in parallel, cached by turbo
bun run check:full     # mirrors .github/workflows/pr.yml (the pull-request gate)
```

| Gate | Command | What it enforces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Format | `bun run check:format` | [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) formatting |
| Lint | `bun run lint` | Biome lint (types, style, complexity) |
| Typecheck | `bun run typecheck` | `tsc` for every package |
| Boundaries | `bun run check:boundaries` | Intra-workspace dep graph plus the state architecture: internal deps resolve, no cycles or self-deps, imports are declared, published dependency rules hold, and providers cannot bypass or reimplement the shared Timeline history coordinator |
| Package integrity | `bun run pack:check` | `dist` + `exports` + `files`, tarball contents, [publint](https://publint.dev), [arethetypeswrong](https://arethetypeswrong.github.io) (ESM-only consumer resolution) |
| Portability | `bun run portability` | Built `dist` matches the package's `mockingbird.runtime` (portable / node / bun) — no Node/Bun-only API usage where it isn't allowed |
| Generate & OpenAPI | `bun run generate` / `bun run openapi:check` | Regenerate and verify provider contracts |
| Test | `bun run test` | Contract, integration, unit, fuzz, and property suites (`FC_NUM_RUNS=40` in CI) |
| Consumer docs | `bun run pack:check` | Every public package ships a README with `## Install`, `## Usage` (a TypeScript example) and `## API` listing every runtime export |
| Consumer smoke | `bun run release:smoke` | Packs every public package like the release, `npm install`s the tarballs into a clean project, imports every entry point under Node, and typechecks them plus every README TypeScript example |
| llms.txt | `bun run check:llms` | [`llms.txt`](../llms.txt) lists every published mock service by release tier (`bun run llms:sync` regenerates) |
| README | `bun run check:readme` | [`README.md`](../README.md) is generated from `sites/docs/src/lib/content.ts`, every service's `package.json` and these guides (`bun run readme:sync` regenerates); never edit it by hand |
| Vendor branding | `bun run check:brands` | `sites/docs/src/data/brands.json` has a logo, color and description for every service's `mockingbird.vendor` (`bun run brands:sync` fetches them; `-- --all --links` refreshes all and checks the links) |
| Docs site | `bun run docs:build` (part of `build`) | [`sites/docs`](../sites/docs) renders the same sources, sends every playground sample to a fresh mock, runs the quick start and SQL snippets, and fails on missing or stale service metadata |
| Agent commands | `bun run check:agents` | Every `.agents/commands/*.md` is symlinked into each agent harness (`bun run agents:sync` repairs) |
| Parity tiers | `bun run check:parity-tiers` | Every service's `mockingbird.parityTier` is `hot`, `warm` or `cold` (absent means cold) |
| Worktree lifecycle | `bun run check:worktree` | Every orchestrator's config (`.superset/`, `.super.engineering/`) runs the same [`scripts/worktree`](../scripts/worktree/README.md) setup, run and teardown (`bun run worktree:sync` regenerates) |

### Git hooks (Husky)

[`commit-msg`](../.husky/commit-msg) runs [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org) via `bunx` for **every commit**, so Conventional Commits are enforced before they reach a PR. Disable hooks per-repo with `HUSKY=0` in `package.json` scripts, or bypass a single commit with `git commit --no-verify` (not recommended).

Keep the committed hook file in `.husky/commit-msg` — the generated `.husky/_` shims are gitignored and are produced by the `prepare` script (`husky`) on install.

### Trunk, checks, and release

`main` is the only long-lived branch. The ruleset rejects direct pushes and force-pushes, with no
bypass, so every change lands through a pull request. The only requirement to merge is that every
pull-request check has passed:

| Check | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| Commitlint | Conventional Commits on the PR's commits, and a Conventional Commits title |
| Check | `bun run check` plus the consumer smoke install (rolls up the Static, Shard and Consumer smoke jobs) |
| GitGuardian Security Checks | Secret scanning |

Advisory checks ([`advisory.yml`](../.github/workflows/advisory.yml)) are not required. There is no
required review, no required approval, and an unresolved review thread does not block the merge. A green pull request is releasable: merging it to `main` publishes. The Release
workflow ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)) builds (replaying main's turbo
cache) and publishes. It does not re-run the pull-request checks. The branch must be up
to date with `main` before merge, so those checks ran against the code that lands. Only merge
commits are allowed, because each commit on the pull request is a release input. Head branches
are deleted on merge. PRs use the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

The gate is codified in `scripts/pr-ready.ts` (`REQUIRED_CHECKS` is the ruleset list — rename a
job in [`.github/workflows/pr.yml`](../.github/workflows/pr.yml) and update that list together):

```bash
bun run pr:ready repo                            # verify merge settings / auto-delete / auto-merge
bun run pr:ready repo --apply
bun run pr:ready ruleset                         # verify the `Protect main` ruleset
bun run pr:ready ruleset --apply
```

### Agent commands

Agent commands are written once in [`.agents/commands/`](../.agents/commands) and symlinked into every
harness — `.claude/commands`, `.cursor/commands`, `.opencode/command`, `.windsurf/workflows`,
`.github/prompts` (Copilot), and `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (Codex / Agent Skills). Edit the
canonical file; `bun run agents:sync` creates missing links and `bun run check:agents` (part of
`bun run check`) fails CI on drift.

`/pr-ready` takes the current branch to a merge-ready PR: commit, push, merge `origin/main`,
resolve conflicts, open the PR, and fix every failing check (CI and third-party checks such as
GitGuardian). It never merges; a human lands the PR once `bun run pr:ready ready` reports it green.
For a clean, committed branch, `bun run pr:ready advance` performs the mechanical steps in one call
and returns JSON for the next blocker. `bun run pr:ready comments` lists review threads and recent
comments when you want to read them.

`/resolve-issues` works the queue of GitHub issues that agents in other projects file through
[REPORTING_ISSUES.md](REPORTING_ISSUES.md) (label `agent-reported`): claim one, confirm the
reported behavior against the oracle, add a regression test, fix the mock, and ship it through
`/pr-ready` with `Fixes #<n>`. `feature` requests become acceptance tests plus contract changes;
`new-service` requests become new packages built through
[AUTHORING_A_SERVICE.md](AUTHORING_A_SERVICE.md).
`bun github:resolve-issues [<issue…>]` runs that command on GitHub, unattended, as you. It
starts the [Resolve issues](../.github/workflows/resolve-issues.yml) workflow with your GitHub token
and your Claude subscription token, and no repo secret. For each issue, an agent opens a draft PR
and carries it to ready-to-merge. With no issue named, it takes the queue in the command's order.
[SECRETS.md](SECRETS.md#resolving-issues-on-github) explains how the credentials reach the run.

### Package publishing

Published services use `publishConfig.access = "public"` and `publishConfig.provenance = true` (npm Trusted Publishing / OIDC). `bun run pack:check` is the pre-publish gate that confirms each package actually packs, resolves types for an ESM-only consumer, and ships `dist`.

### Docs site hosting

The docs site (`sites/docs`) is hosted on the shared `crvouga/workspace` fleet as the service
`mockingbird-docs` ([shared-infra contract §4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crvouga/workspace/main/llms.txt)).
[`sites/docs/Dockerfile`](../sites/docs/Dockerfile) builds the static Astro site and serves it
with nginx on port 80. Its build context is the repo root, because the site renders every service
package. On every push to `main`, [`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](../.github/workflows/publish.yml)
calls the workspace's reusable workflow. That workflow pushes `ghcr.io/crvouga/chrisvouga-mockingbird-docs:<sha>`,
and then `crvouga/workspace` deploys that exact image and health-checks it. Railway never builds this repo.

To check the image locally, run `docker build -f sites/docs/Dockerfile -t mockingbird-docs . && docker run --rm -p 8080:80 mockingbird-docs`.
