# @emulates/firstpromoter

> Part of [Emulates](https://github.com/crvouga/emulators): high-fidelity, in-process emulators for APIs and databases.

Stateful emulator of the **FirstPromoter v2** affiliate API for test suites: promoter create (adopt
before create by `cust_id`), lookups by id / `cust_id` / `ref_token` / email, list, update,
archive, the dashboard iframe login, signup tracking by click `tid`, `promoter_id` or ref token,
and the Basic-auth `lead_becomes_referral` webhook our backend receives. Every request is
recorded in the journal, so a checkout suite can assert what the post-checkout job sent instead
of producing a failed job.

- Operation coverage: [SUPPORT.md](https://github.com/crvouga/emulators/blob/main/packages/service/firstpromoter/SUPPORT.md)
- FirstPromoter publishes no machine-readable spec: the contract (`openapi.yaml`) is
  hand-authored from our consumer's requests and the zod schemas it validates responses with.

## Install

```bash
npm install -D @emulates/firstpromoter
```

ESM only. Node >= 22 or Bun >= 1.2. No native dependencies. Serve it with
`npx emulates-firstpromoter serve`, `createServer` from `./server` (Node), or `createRuntime`
with any Fetch server.

## Usage

Point `FIRST_PROMOTER_API_URL` at the emulator (our Joi schema requires `https`, so either front it
with TLS or relax that rule in the stack), set any `FIRST_PROMOTER_API_KEY` and
`FIRST_PROMOTER_ACCOUNT_ID`, and pass the webhook Basic-auth pair as `--webhook-secret`.

```bash
npx emulates-firstpromoter serve --port 8812 \
  --webhook-url http://127.0.0.1:3000/users/webhooks/first-promoter \
  --webhook-secret "$FIRST_PROMOTER_WEBHOOK_AUTH_USERNAME:$FIRST_PROMOTER_WEBHOOK_AUTH_PASSWORD"
```

```ts
import { createRuntime } from "@emulates/firstpromoter"

const fp = createRuntime({
  webhooks: { url: "http://127.0.0.1:3000/users/webhooks/first-promoter", secret: "user:pass" },
})
const admin = (path: string, body: unknown) =>
  fp.fetch(
    new Request(`http://fp.test/__admin${path}`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify(body),
    }),
  )

// An existing affiliate, and a click on their link: the tid checkout stores as fp_tid.
await admin("/promoters", { email: "nate@example.com", ref_token: "nate91" })
const { tid } = (await (await admin("/clicks", { ref_token: "nate91" })).json()) as { tid: string }
// …the app's invoice handler posts POST /v2/track/signup {email, tid}; the mock converts the
// referral and posts lead_becomes_referral to the backend with Authorization: Basic…
```

### Routes

| Route | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /v2/company/promoters` | `{email, cust_id?, profile?: {first_name, last_name}, drip_emails?, initial_campaign_id?}` → the promoter (`FirstPromoterV2ResponseSchema`), enrolled in the default campaign with a `ref_token` (first name + digits) and `ref_link` `https://acme.example/referrals?fpr=<token>`. A live promoter with the same email or `cust_id` is 422 `{message, errors: {email: ["has already been taken"]}}`. |
| `GET /v2/company/promoters?page=&per_page=` | `{data: [promoter], meta: {pending_count}}`; archived promoters are left out. |
| `GET /v2/company/promoters/{value}?find_by=id\|cust_id\|ref_token\|email` | One promoter (archived ones too, with `archived_at`), or 404 `{message: "Promoter not found"}`. |
| `PUT /v2/company/promoters/{id}` | `{cust_id?, email?, note?, profile?}` → the promoter; 404 / 422 as above. |
| `POST /v2/company/promoters/archive` | `{ids: [..]}` → a completed batch `{id, status, total, selected_total, processed_count, failed_count, action_label, progress, processing_errors, …}`. |
| `POST /v2/promoters/iframe_login?promoter_id=` | `{access_token, expires_in}`, or 404. |
| `POST /v2/track/signup` | `{email, tid? \| promoter_id? \| ref_id?, uid?, skip_email_notification?}` → the referral. An unknown `tid`, promoter or ref token is 404; none of them is 400; an email already tracked is 422. With `autoConvert` (default on) the referral becomes a customer at once and `lead_becomes_referral` is posted. |
| `GET /v2/company/referrals` | A bare array of stored referrals and live promoter/campaign metadata. `q` searches email/uid; `ids[]`, `filters[type]=lead\|customer`, `filters[state]`, `filters[promoter_id]`, and inclusive `filters[created_at\|customer_since][from\|to]` filter before paging. `page` starts at 1; `per_page` defaults to 20 (max 100). Exhausted pages and unmatched searches return `[]`. |
| `GET /v2/company/referrals/{id}` | The same referral projection as listing. A numeric ID or `find_by=email\|uid` selects it; missing records are 404. |

The [official referral reference](https://docs.firstpromoter.com/api-reference-v2/api-admin/referrals/get-referrals)
specifies the bare array. Paging parameters and limits follow the official
[n8n client](https://github.com/firstpromoter/n8n-app/blob/0842d761a3c024e7cf3030e5a108447375f03807/nodes/FirstPromoter/GeneralFunctions.ts)
and [input definitions](https://github.com/firstpromoter/n8n-app/blob/0842d761a3c024e7cf3030e5a108447375f03807/nodes/FirstPromoter/FirstPromoter.node.ts).

Every call needs `Authorization: Bearer <key>` and an `Account-ID` header (else 401).

### Webhooks

`lead_becomes_referral` bodies match our `FirstPromoterNewCustomerWebhookSchema`: `{event: {id,
type, created_at}, data: {id, state, email, customer_since, promotion: {id, promoter_id, ref_id,
leads_count, customers_count, current_referral_reward}, promoter: {id, cust_id, email,
earnings_balance: {cash}}}}`, sent with `Authorization: Basic base64(<secret>)` where the secret
is `user:pass`. Non-2xx answers are retried; `GET /__admin/webhooks`, `…/events`, `…/flush` and
`PUT /__admin/webhook-endpoints` work as usual.

### Admin (beyond the standard contract)

| Route | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /__admin/promoters` | Seed a promoter `{email, cust_id?, first_name?, last_name?, ref_token?, campaign_id?}`. |
| `GET /__admin/promoters` | The namespace's promoters (stored form). |
| `POST /__admin/clicks` | `{ref_token}` → `{tid, promoterId}`: a click on the promoter's link. |
| `GET /__admin/referrals` | Tracked signups. |
| `POST /__admin/referrals/:id/convert` | `{saleAmount?}`: the lead paid; credits the promoter (percent reward × amount) and posts the webhook. |
| `POST /__admin/commissions` | Seed a commission against an existing `{promoter_campaign_id, amount, unit?, status?, fulfilled?, is_paid?, referral_id?, sale_amount?, event_id?}`. Defaults: approved, points, unfulfilled/unpaid. A referral must belong to that promoter and campaign. |
| `POST /__admin/promo-codes` | Seed `{promo_code, promoter_campaign_id}` against an existing promoter campaign for sale attribution tests. |
| `GET\|PUT /__admin/settings` | `{website?, defaultCampaignId?, autoConvert?, campaigns?}` (campaigns carry `referralRewards` / `promoterRewards` with `coupon`, `amount`, `unit`, `per_of_sale`). The default campaign's referral coupon is `ACME50`. |

Fault presets (`POST /__admin/faults {"preset": "<name>", "count"?: n}`; `GET /__admin/faults/presets`):
`created_but_500` (stored, then 500: the retry must adopt by `cust_id`), `lookup_unavailable`
(lookups 503: neither create nor adopt), `no_campaign` (no `promoter_campaigns`: no ref link),
`unauthorized`, `rate_limited`, `server_error`, `connection_drop`, `webhook_duplicate`,
`webhook_drop`.

Commission reconciliation follows FirstPromoter's [published contract](https://github.com/firstpromoter/docs/blob/d4e9e6f16bf4801c524508d2809a425ea6419d7d/api-reference-v2/api-admin/commissions/openapi-v2-commissions.json):
`GET /v2/company/commissions` returns a bare array, newest first, with `q`, repeated `ids[]`,
`page` / `per_page` (1 / 20 by default, maximum 100), and filters for `status`, nonmonetary
`fulfilled=yes|no`, monetary `paid=yes|no`, `promoter_id`, `campaign_id`, amount / sale-amount
ranges and creation-date ranges. `POST …/commissions/mark_fulfilled` fulfills nonmonetary
commissions; `DELETE …/commissions/destroy` deletes selected commissions. Both take `{ids}`.
Batches of at most five IDs return 200/completed; larger batches return 202/pending. In the
emulator they move to in_progress after the clock advances and complete at 1,000 ms, on the next
authenticated API call. The batch collections and pending work participate in reset and snapshots.
`GET …/batch_processes` and `…/batch_processes/progress` list unfinished work by default
(`filters[status]` selects another status); `GET …/batch_processes/{id}` returns counts and
processing errors. `batch_partial_failure` fails the first selected item while processing the
others. Timing, missing-ID/monetary-item error text, and this preset are synthetic controls;
they are not claims about the vendor's worker timing or exact error messages. Fulfillment is
stored separately from the vendor's `is_paid` monetary field.

`POST /v2/track/sale` follows the vendor's [sale contract](https://github.com/firstpromoter/docs/blob/d4e9e6f16bf4801c524508d2809a425ea6419d7d/api-reference-v2/api-admin/tracking-api/openapi-v2-tracking.json):
`{event_id, amount, email|uid, currency?, plan?, promo_code?, ref_id?, tid?, skip_email_notification?}`
records a positive integer amount in minor units against a tracked referral. The first configured
campaign reward supplies an approved commission; percent rewards are rounded to the nearest
minor unit, and flat rewards use their configured amount. Cash rewards also credit the existing
promoter balance; nonmonetary rewards do not. The response includes the referral, amount and
linked commissions, visible in the commission collection. Replaying an event ID returns the
documented 409 without another credit, commission or webhook. Unknown referrals, archived
promoters and unmatched supplied attribution tokens return the documented 404 `not_found` shape.
Codes must be seeded through the admin control; tokens must belong to the referral's promoter
campaign. All validation precedes sale/commission/balance writes; snapshots/reset include event
deduplication. A successful sale preserves the existing conversion webhook behavior.

### Namespaces

`x-emulates-namespace`, a `/__admin/ns/<name>` prefix in `FIRST_PROMOTER_API_URL`, or by API key:
`PUT /__admin/credentials {"credentials": {"<FIRST_PROMOTER_API_KEY>": "<namespace>"}}`.

### Deliberately not modelled

- Error bodies and exact status codes of the real API are unverified (no sandbox credentials):
  errors use `{message}` and validation `{message, errors: {field: [...]}}`. Our consumer only
  branches on `ok` / 404, which the emulator gets right.
- The v1 API our EMR backend still calls (`/v1/promoters/*`, `/v1/track/signup`,
  `/v1/reports/campaigns`); the catalog scopes this emulator to v2.
- Refunds, standalone commission creation/editing/approval, cash payouts and commission filters
  beyond those listed above; fraud checks;
  public promo-code provisioning; the hosted affiliate portal behind the iframe token.
- Sale tracking requires an existing referral (the vendor's one-step signup bypass is unmodelled).
  Currency is recorded without foreign-exchange conversion; plan-specific rewards, quantity/MRR
  calculations, multiple reward tiers, split commissions and notification emails are unmodelled.
  Commission rounding and immediate approval are deterministic emulator policies, not live-verified
  campaign policy. The default campaign reward remains 10 percent, as before.
- Referral editing/deletion, username/website profile provisioning, cancelled-date filters and split attribution.
- Promoter ids are sequential from 4800001 per namespace.
