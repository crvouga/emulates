| `oracle-pglite-version` | oracle | The default differential oracle is PGlite (embedded PostgreSQL 18.x WASM); a secondary native-server oracle is available via POSTGRES_MEM_ORACLE=server. server_version must be 18.3 or 18.1 for either path. | `scripts/postgres-compat-gate.ts`, `tests/harness/oracle-versions.ts`, `scripts/run-postgres-native-tests.ts` |
| `deterministic-runtime` | engine | random()/gen_random_uuid() are seeded-deterministic and now() is fixed to 2000-01-01 UTC by default; both are injectable via DatabaseOptions; the PRNG participates in transaction rollback and snapshots | `DAT-now-01`, `DET-seed-01`, `DET-seed-02`, `DET-now-01`, `DET-now-02`, `DET-uuid-01`, `DET-rb-01`, `DET-snap-01`, `DET-setseed-01`, `DET-scan-01`, `tests/contract/determinism/basic.test.ts` |
| `pgmm-snapshot-codec` | engine | snapshot()/encode()/decode() use the custom PGMM binary codec (magic 'PGMM' + LE u32 version), not pg_dump or the on-disk PostgreSQL format | `SNP-rt-01`, `SNP-rt-02`, `SNP-rt-03`, `SNP-rt-04`, `SNP-rt-05`, `SNP-byte-01`, `SNP-hdr-01`, `SNP-hdr-02`, `SNP-hdr-03`, `SNP-hdr-04`, `SNP-txn-01`, `SNP-open-01`, `SNP-open-02`, `tests/contract/snapshots/basic.test.ts` |
| `copy-stdin-api` | api | COPY ... FROM STDIN is fed through the copyFrom(sql, text) API hook and COPY ... TO STDOUT returns the rendered text from exec; PGlite exposes a different (protocol-level) COPY interface | `CPY-from-01`, `CPY-from-02`, `CPY-from-03`, `CPY-from-04`, `CPY-from-05`, `CPY-csv-01`, `CPY-csv-02`, `CPY-csv-03`, `CPY-to-01`, `CPY-to-02`, `CPY-to-03`, `CPY-to-04`, `CPY-rt-01`, `CPY-api-01`, `tests/contract/copy/basic.test.ts` |
| `sync-api-surface` | api | The public Database/Statement API is synchronous (exec/query/prepare/transaction/snapshot/restore/close return values, not Promises); PGlite and pg clients are asynchronous | `API-exec-01`, `API-exec-02`, `API-query-01`, `API-prep-01`, `API-run-01`, `API-run-02`, `API-run-03`, `API-bind-02`, `API-bind-03`, `API-ret-01`, `API-ret-02`, `API-close-01`, `API-txn-01`, `API-txn-02`, `API-sync-01`, `API-copy-01`, `API-int8-01`, `API-int8-02`, `API-fn-01`, `tests/contract/api/basic.test.ts` |
| `dump-compat-noop` | sql | DO blocks and ALTER TABLE SET (storage/reloptions) execute as no-ops so schema dumps can load without intercepts; PL/pgSQL and storage parameters are NOT APPLICABLE | `API-dump-01`, `API-do-01`, `API-set-01` |
| `empty-script-rejected` | sql | exec of a statement-free script (comments/whitespace only) raises an empty-statement error; PostgreSQL accepts it as a no-op | `TOK-cmt-04` |
| `row-value-subquery-arity` | sql | Row-constructor arity mismatches surface at execution (21000) instead of parse time (42601), and multi-column row-value IN (SELECT ...) is rejected as unsupported | `PAR-row-03`, `EXP-in-03` |
| `float8-overflow-saturates` | sql | '1e400'::float8 saturates to Infinity instead of raising 22003 out of range | `TYP-float-04` |
| `round-half-away-from-zero` | sql | round(float8) rounds ties away from zero (round(2.5::float8) = 3); PostgreSQL rounds half to even (= 2) | `FUN-round-02` |
| `drop-cascade-view-retained` | sql | DROP TABLE ... CASCADE does not drop dependent views; the view remains and errors when queried | `DDL-drop-03` |
| `comment-on-not-stored` | sql | COMMENT ON for any object other than an index parses and succeeds but the comment is not stored; obj_description() / col_description() return NULL for it and pg_description has no row | `DDL-comment-01` |
| `trigger-order-creation` | sql | Multiple triggers on the same event fire in creation order; PostgreSQL fires them in name order | `TRG-order-01` |
| `trigger-update-of-ignored` | sql | UPDATE OF column lists on triggers are parsed but ignored; the trigger fires for every UPDATE | `TRG-updof-01` |
| `instead-of-triggers-unsupported` | sql | CREATE TRIGGER ... INSTEAD OF on a view fails loud; PostgreSQL supports INSTEAD OF triggers on views | `TRG-instead-01` |
| `no-aborted-transaction-state` | sql | After a failed statement inside BEGIN, subsequent statements keep executing; PostgreSQL rejects them with 25P02 until ROLLBACK | `TXN-abort-01` |
| `version-banner` | catalog | version() returns 'PostgreSQL 18.3 (postgres-mem) on TypeScript, in-memory engine' instead of the real build banner | `CAT-ver-01` |
| `pg-get-viewdef-missing` | catalog | pg_get_viewdef() is not implemented and raises 42883 | `CAT-viewdef-01` |
| `storage-persistence-catalog-only` | sql | Column storage modes (STORAGE / SET STORAGE, pg_attribute.attstorage) and relation persistence (UNLOGGED, SET LOGGED / UNLOGGED, pg_class.relpersistence) are catalog metadata only: there is no TOAST and no write-ahead log | `tests/contract/alter-table/set-storage.test.ts`, `tests/contract/alter-table/set-logged.test.ts` |
| `extension-catalog-subset` | catalog | pg_available_extensions, pg_available_extension_versions and pg_extension list only the extensions the engine can install (pgcrypto, pg_trgm) plus the built-in plpgsql; DROP EXTENSION plpgsql is refused with 0A000 | `tests/contract/extensions/catalogs.test.ts` |
| `concurrent-index-build-fault` | engine | Database.fault({ concurrentIndexBuild: sqlstate }) and, on the wire server, server.fault({ failConcurrentIndexBuild: sqlstate }) make the next CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY or REINDEX ... CONCURRENTLY fail with that SQLSTATE and leave the index it was building in the catalog with indisvalid = false, indisready = false, indislive = true | `CAT-index-valid-07`, `tests/contract/catalogs/index-validity.test.ts`, `tests/wire/index-catalog.test.ts` |
| `pg-stat-counters-immediate` | catalog | pg_stat_user_tables.n_live_tup is the exact current row count, current as soon as a statement finishes; seq_scan, seq_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch, n_tup_ins / n_tup_upd / n_tup_del, n_tup_hot_upd, n_dead_tup, n_mod_since_analyze and the vacuum columns are not tracked and read zero or NULL; idx_scan (also in pg_stat_user_indexes) counts only the unique-key equality lookups the engine performs for SELECT; VACUUM, including VACUUM ANALYZE, is a no-op and does not count | `CAT-table-stat-04`, `tests/contract/catalogs/table-statistics.test.ts` |
| `pg-index-catalog-subset` | catalog | pg_index exposes indexrelid, indrelid, indnatts, indnkeyatts and the boolean flags; indexprs and indpred are the deparsed text that pg_get_expr() returns rather than pg_node_tree, and indkey, indcollation, indclass and indoption are absent. Index access methods other than btree are recorded and rendered (USING hash / gin / gist / spgist / brin) but every index is maintained the same way | `tests/contract/catalogs/index-definitions.test.ts` |

## Specified behavior

### `oracle-pglite-version`

Harness bootstrap asserts current_setting('server_version') is in {18.3, 18.1}. Default CI uses PGlite; `bun run test:postgres-native` (and CI job test-native-oracle) runs the same suite against a real PostgreSQL 18.3 process.

### `deterministic-runtime`

By design, two Database instances with the same seed produce identical random streams and identical now() values. PostgreSQL is wall-clock and entropy driven. Tests assert memory behavior only.

### `pgmm-snapshot-codec`

Snapshots are byte-identical for equivalent logical state, refuse corrupt/truncated/future-version blobs, and cannot run inside a transaction. No PostgreSQL equivalent exists; tests assert memory behavior only.

### `copy-stdin-api`

Text and CSV COPY semantics (\N nulls, escapes, \. terminator, HEADER/DELIMITER/NULL options, column lists) follow PostgreSQL 18; the transport is the JS API rather than the wire protocol, so these are memory-only assertions.

### `sync-api-surface`

API shape mirrors sqlite-mem: run/all/get/result, $1..$n parameters, bigint for int8, canonical text for numeric/date/jsonb, misuse errors for wrong usage. Asserted memory-only because no PostgreSQL client shares this surface.

### `dump-compat-noop`

exec() loads schema dumps. DO $$ … $$ and ALTER TABLE … SET (fillfactor=…) succeed and change nothing. PGlite executes plpgsql; these cases are memory-only.

### `empty-script-rejected`

postgres-mem requires at least one statement per exec call.

### `row-value-subquery-arity`

Single-column IN subqueries have full parity; multi-column row-value subquery comparison is out of scope for this milestone and fails loud.

### `float8-overflow-saturates`

float8 text input uses JS Number parsing, which saturates. In-range values have full parity.

### `round-half-away-from-zero`

numeric round() has full parity; only the float8 overload diverges on exact .5 ties.

### `drop-cascade-view-retained`

Dependency tracking for CASCADE drops of views is not implemented; drop the view explicitly.

### `comment-on-not-stored`

COMMENT ON INDEX is persisted (pg_description, obj_description) and differential-tested. For tables, columns and every other object kind COMMENT ON is accepted for compatibility and the description is not persisted; a missing target of those kinds is not an error either.

### `trigger-order-creation`

Name your triggers so alphabetical order matches creation order if ordering matters.

### `trigger-update-of-ignored`

Column-filtered trigger firing is not implemented; guard inside the trigger body instead.

### `instead-of-triggers-unsupported`

INSTEAD OF triggers are out of scope for this milestone.

### `no-aborted-transaction-state`

The aborted-transaction latch is not implemented; each statement is validated independently.

### `version-banner`

server_version/server_version_num report 18.3/180003 for compatibility; the full banner names postgres-mem.

### `pg-get-viewdef-missing`

View definitions are visible via information_schema.views.view_definition (stored SQL text).

### `storage-persistence-catalog-only`

The SQL and catalog contract matches PostgreSQL, including its errors for invalid modes, targets and conversions, and is differential-tested. Physically nothing changes: values are never compressed or moved out of line, an unlogged table is stored like a logged one, is not truncated by a crash and is part of every snapshot. PostgreSQL also keeps a storage mode for materialized-view columns; here ALTER COLUMN ... SET STORAGE on a materialized view fails loud with 0A000.

### `extension-catalog-subset`

A stock PostgreSQL server lists every contrib module it ships; here an extension that is not implemented is absent from the views (zero rows) and CREATE EXTENSION fails with 0A000, as it does on a server without that control file. The PGlite oracle is built with exactly the same three extensions, so the views are compared in full. plpgsql cannot be dropped because the language is part of the engine; PostgreSQL allows dropping and recreating it.

### `concurrent-index-build-fault`

PostgreSQL leaves such an invalid index when a concurrent build is canceled, deadlocks or otherwise fails partway (sql-createindex, 'Building Indexes Concurrently'); an interruption cannot be provoked deterministically in the oracle, so this one-shot test control stands in for it. The failure PostgreSQL can be made to produce, duplicate keys in a concurrent unique build, is differential-tested, as are DROP INDEX and REINDEX as the repair. The preset models an interruption in the build phase, the state PostgreSQL shows for the duplicate-key failure (not ready, so not maintained and not enforcing). A failure in the later validation scan, where PostgreSQL leaves indisready = true and a unique index keeps enforcing, is not modeled. The fault is not part of snapshots and is not undone by a rollback.

### `pg-stat-counters-immediate`

PostgreSQL reports these counters asynchronously (after pg_stat_force_next_flush() or a delay) and n_live_tup is an estimate that ANALYZE resets. The differential tests read after pg_stat_force_next_flush() and ANALYZE, where PostgreSQL's value is the row count too, and compare relid, schemaname, relname, n_live_tup, analyze_count, last_analyze and the column list and types of both views. There are no dead tuples and no planner, so the activity counters have nothing to count; treat them as absent, not as zero activity.

### `pg-index-catalog-subset`

pg_get_indexdef(), pg_indexes.indexdef and pg_get_expr(indpred | indexprs, indrelid) are differential-tested against PostgreSQL across methods, ordering, NULLS placement, INCLUDE, operator classes, collations, storage parameters, quoted identifiers and an expression / predicate matrix. Read index columns through pg_get_indexdef(oid, n, pretty) instead of indkey. Expressions outside that matrix (subqueries, row constructors, SIMILAR TO, array slices, window or aggregate calls) are rendered best-effort.
