# Compatibility

Goal: **PostgreSQL 18 SQL dialect behavioral parity** as a drop-in for the same statements against the reference oracle. Compatibility is proven by the differential contract suite and the fail-closed gate:

```bash
bun run test:postgres-compat
```

See [COMPATIBILITY-AUDIT.md](COMPATIBILITY-AUDIT.md) for the latest evidence-based audit report.

Reference oracle: **PostgreSQL 18.3** via PGlite (`@electric-sql/pglite`, real Postgres compiled to WASM, in-process). Inventory: `bun run inventory`. Construct catalog: `bun run scenarios` → [`compat/scenarios.ts`](compat/scenarios.ts). Divergences: [`compat/divergences.json`](compat/divergences.json). Requirements matrix: `bun run requirements` → `compat/requirements.json` + `compat/coverage.json`.

The Node `/server` entry participates in protocol fleets. Acceptance tests use `pg@8.23.0`
for authenticated readiness, shutdown, namespace isolation, full-catalog reset/snapshot/restore and
clock controls. This supervisor surface does not change the SQL dialect compatibility contract.

## Proof surface

Differential tests compare a **tuple** per statement: rows (normalized to canonical PostgreSQL text where typed), column names and type names where requested, error SQLSTATE class + normalized message, command tag / `rowCount`, and transaction status, plus a **logical state dump** (catalog names, column definitions, row payloads, sequence values) after write sequences.

A catalog ID appearing in a test file is **not** proof by itself. Trivial probes are tracked in [`compat/smoke-baseline.json`](compat/smoke-baseline.json) and ratcheted downward (currently **0 smoke stubs** across 998 catalog scenarios). Generated operator/cast matrices live under [`tests/contract/matrices/`](tests/contract/matrices/). Observed mem≠oracle diffs must bind to a `compat/divergences.json` entry or be a **FAILURE** — unexplained diffs are not allowed.

Intentional differences are finite and machine-readable in `compat/divergences.json` (PGMM snapshots, seeded `random()`/`now()`, sync single-session API, no aborted-transaction state, EXPLAIN stubs, trigger-order/`UPDATE OF` edges, float8 rounding/overflow edges, …). The wire server supports isolated database catalogs, startup selection, database lifecycle DDL, and copy-on-write template cloning. Human-readable: [DIVERGENCES.md](DIVERGENCES.md).

The wire server supports protocol-v3 text and CSV `COPY FROM STDIN` / `COPY TO STDOUT`, including
incremental `CopyData`, client aborts, and statement-atomic rollback. Binary COPY remains outside
the compatibility surface.

The wire server keeps settings per connection and applies the startup packet's run-time parameters
(libpq `options=-c name=value` / `--name=value`, split like `pg_split_opts`, then parameters sent by
name) as session defaults that `RESET` returns to. Malformed options, unknown parameters, bad
values and read-only parameters end the connection with the `FATAL` SQLSTATEs PostgreSQL 18.3
reports (`42601`, `42704`, `22023`, `55P02`), pinned by `tests/wire/startup-options.test.ts`.
Known gaps: parameters the engine has no setting for are `42704`, `postgres` switches other than
`-c` / `--` are `0A000`, `ParameterStatus` is not re-sent when a reported setting changes,
`SET LOCAL` does not carry across the statements of a wire transaction block, `DISCARD ALL` is a
no-op, and with no schema of `search_path` present an unqualified `CREATE` goes to `public` where
PostgreSQL raises `3F000`.

The wire server's opt-in durable mode (`serve({ durable })`, `--durable <dir>`) persists the
cluster before a commit is acknowledged, so acknowledged commits survive a killed process. It is
snapshot persistence of PGMM bytes behind an injectable storage port, with an atomic file-backed
implementation. It is not a write-ahead log and not PostgreSQL's on-disk format: there is no
`pg_wal`, no data directory another PostgreSQL could open, no physical replication or
point-in-time recovery, and each commit costs an encode of the database it changed. See the README
for the guarantees and their limits (`tests/wire/durable*.test.ts`, `tests/wire/file-storage.test.ts`).

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **VERIFIED** | Differential contracts (+ fuzz where applicable) cover happy path **and** meaningful edges vs oracle |
| **PARTIALLY VERIFIED** | Implemented; coverage thin or known edges remain |
| **UNSUPPORTED** | Missing from SQL surface (must fail loud; gate fails if oracle-exposed and unregistered) |
| **NOT APPLICABLE** | Outside the SQL-dialect surface (roles/auth, replication, storage). The wire protocol is provided by the optional `/server` entry, documented in the README. |

## Scope bound

Anything a PostgreSQL application can invoke through SQL against the PGlite **18.3** oracle must match observable behavior, except:

1. **Snapshot format** — custom binary codec (`PGMM`), not `pg_dump` / on-disk clusters (logical state still round-trips).
2. **Deterministic `random()` / `now()`** — seeded PRNG and fixed clock by default (injectable).
3. **Single-session sync API** — no concurrent sessions or `25P02` aborted-transaction state. The optional wire server separately provides per-session `READ COMMITTED` workspaces and row locks.
4. **NOT APPLICABLE** rows in `compat/coverage.json` (roles, replication, VACUUM internals, LISTEN/NOTIFY, cursors, full PL/pgSQL, extensions other than `pgcrypto`'s `digest()` and `pg_trgm`'s `similarity` / `<%` / `gin_trgm_ops`).

The oracle exposes **2787 builtin functions** and **74 operators** in `pg_catalog`; postgres-mem implements **306 functions** and **41 operators**, and every remaining item is an explicit entry in [`compat/unsupported-register.json`](compat/unsupported-register.json) with a reason (trigger/internal plumbing, admin/monitoring, unsupported type families, …). The gate fails closed on silence.

## Requirements coverage (PostgreSQL 18 SQL commands)

`bun run requirements` ingests the PostgreSQL 18 SQL-commands documentation index: **183 commands** → 56 NOT APPLICABLE, 127 SQL-behavior. Of the SQL-behavior commands: **43 VERIFIED**, **26 PARTIALLY VERIFIED**, **58 UNSUPPORTED** (fail-loud, registered). Full detail: `compat/coverage.json`.

## Feature matrix (summary)

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core DML / SELECT / joins / CTE / ON CONFLICT / RETURNING | VERIFIED | Contract + fuzz |
| Types: bool/int2/4/8, float4/8, numeric, text/varchar/char, bytea, uuid | VERIFIED | numeric is in-repo arbitrary precision |
| Date/time: date, time, timestamp[tz], interval + arithmetic | VERIFIED | Timezone conversions for named zones; some interval corners partial |
| Casts (implicit/assignment/explicit) | VERIFIED | Generated cast matrices from oracle |
| Arrays + unnest + subscripts/slices | VERIFIED | |
| JSON / JSONB operators + functions | VERIFIED | |
| Window functions (frames, EXCLUDE) | VERIFIED | |
| GROUPING SETS / ROLLUP / CUBE, DISTINCT ON, LATERAL, set ops | VERIFIED | |
| Recursive + data-modifying CTEs | VERIFIED | |
| Constraints: PK / UNIQUE / NOT NULL / CHECK / FK actions | VERIFIED | DEFERRABLE parsed, checked at statement end |
| Sequences / serial / identity | VERIFIED | Includes pg_dump identity sequence names and options |
| Schemas + search_path + pg_catalog / information_schema | VERIFIED | Catalog columns are the commonly-queried subset |
| Enums, domains, generated columns | VERIFIED | |
| `ALTER COLUMN SET / DROP NOT NULL`, `SET / DROP DEFAULT` | VERIFIED | PostgreSQL's errors for existing NULLs (`23502`), primary-key and identity columns, column references and subqueries in a default, and literals that are not valid input for the column type. Every action of one `ALTER TABLE` applies or none does. An undefined function in a default is reported when a row first uses it, not by `ALTER TABLE` (`tests/contract/alter-table/set-not-null.test.ts`, `set-default.test.ts`) |
| `information_schema.columns.column_default` | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | Rendered the way `pg_get_expr` prints the analyzed default: constants of every type, casts, SQL value functions, `nextval`, the built-in functions with a signature on record, operators, `ARRAY[...]`, `CASE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`. Functions outside that table print an untyped literal argument as `text`; `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(n)`, `current_schema()` and unary `+` lose the detail the parser drops; a nested `CASE` is printed on one line. `pg_attrdef` and `pg_get_expr` are not exposed |
| `ALTER COLUMN SET STORAGE`, `STORAGE` column clause, `pg_attribute.attstorage` | VERIFIED | SQL and catalog contract only: `PLAIN` / `EXTERNAL` / `EXTENDED` / `MAIN` / `DEFAULT`, per-type defaults, `LIKE ... INCLUDING STORAGE`, PostgreSQL's errors for an unknown mode (`22023`), a non-toastable type (`0A000`) and a missing column. **No TOAST**: values are never compressed or moved out of line, so the mode changes nothing about how rows are held. `SET STORAGE` on a materialized view fails loud (`0A000`); `SET COMPRESSION` is unsupported (`tests/contract/alter-table/set-storage.test.ts`) |
| `CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE / SEQUENCE`, `SET LOGGED / UNLOGGED`, `pg_class.relpersistence` | VERIFIED | SQL and catalog contract only: `p` / `u` / `t` for tables, their indexes and owned sequences; contents, indexes and constraints are kept across a conversion; PostgreSQL's errors for temporary tables, for logged / unlogged / temporary foreign-key combinations (`42P16`) and for a second change in one statement. **No WAL and no crash recovery**: an unlogged table is stored exactly like a logged one, is not truncated after a crash, and is included in snapshots (`tests/contract/alter-table/set-logged.test.ts`) |
| Index identity: `pg_class` / `pg_index` / `pg_indexes` / `pg_am` / `pg_constraint.conindid` | VERIFIED | Every index is a relation with its own oid, distinct from its table, kept through `ALTER INDEX / TABLE / SCHEMA ... RENAME`, `SET SCHEMA`, transactions and snapshots; `DROP` + `CREATE` and `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` make a new one. The index behind a `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` constraint appears in all of them and follows `ADD / RENAME / DROP CONSTRAINT`; dropping it directly is `2BP01`. Snapshots written before indexes had oids load with distinct ones. `pg_index` has the flag columns only: `indexprs` / `indpred` are the text `pg_get_expr()` returns, and `indkey`, `indclass`, `indoption`, `indcollation` are absent. A constraint's index name must be free among the schema's relations (`42P07`), and a generated name steps past one that is taken (`t_pkey1`) (`tests/contract/catalogs/index-definitions.test.ts`) |
| `pg_get_indexdef(oid)`, `pg_get_indexdef(oid, column, pretty)`, `pg_indexes.indexdef` | VERIFIED | `UNIQUE`, `USING` method, `DESC` / `NULLS FIRST / LAST`, `INCLUDE`, non-default operator classes, `COLLATE`, `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`, `WITH (...)`, quoted identifiers (every non-unreserved keyword), and expressions and predicates printed as PostgreSQL prints the analyzed tree: typed constants, the implicit casts operator resolution adds, `= ANY (ARRAY[...])` for `IN`, `~~` for `LIKE`, expanded `BETWEEN`, flattened `AND` / `OR`, `CASE` layout, SQL-syntax functions. Column positions past the end or negative are `''`, an oid that is not an index is NULL, and pretty-printing drops the schema and redundant parentheses. Differential over a 127-index construct matrix; expressions outside it (subqueries, row constructors, `SIMILAR TO`, array slices) are best-effort. Access methods other than btree are recorded and rendered, not implemented differently (`tests/contract/catalogs/index-definitions.test.ts`) |
| `pg_index.indisvalid`, `CREATE / DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, `REINDEX` | VERIFIED | Completed indexes are valid, ready and live. A concurrent unique build that hits duplicates fails (`23505`) and leaves the index in the catalog, invalid and not enforced; `DROP INDEX` removes it and `REINDEX INDEX / TABLE / SCHEMA / DATABASE` repairs it once the data allows; a failed `REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY` leaves `name_ccnew`. The commands PostgreSQL refuses in a transaction block are `25001`. An *interrupted* build (cancel, deadlock) cannot be provoked in the oracle: `Database.fault({ concurrentIndexBuild: "57014" })` and `server.fault({ failConcurrentIndexBuild })` arm one for tests, in the build-phase state (`indisready = false`); the state a failure in the later validation scan leaves (`indisready = true`, still enforcing) is not modelled (divergence `concurrent-index-build-fault`). `REINDEX` has no physical index to rebuild (`tests/contract/catalogs/index-validity.test.ts`, `tests/wire/index-catalog.test.ts`) |
| `COMMENT ON INDEX`, `pg_description`, `obj_description` | VERIFIED | Stored on the index: replace, clear with `NULL` or `''`, removed with the index / table / schema, kept through renames, transactional, in snapshots, isolated per wire transaction; `42P01` / `3F000` / `42809` for a missing index, a missing schema, a relation that is not an index. Comments on every other kind of object are still accepted and not stored (divergence `comment-on-not-stored`) (`tests/contract/catalogs/index-comments.test.ts`) |
| `regnamespace`, `to_regnamespace` | VERIFIED | Input (`-`, an all-digit oid, or exactly one identifier, case-folded unless quoted), output (quoted like `quote_ident`, numeric when no schema has the oid, `-` for zero), casts from text / name / oid / integers, implicit use as `oid` in comparisons, `pg_toast` / `pg_catalog` / `information_schema`; `3F000`, `42602` and `22003` as PostgreSQL raises them. `public` has a generated oid, not 2200 (`tests/contract/catalogs/regnamespace.test.ts`) |
| `pg_stat_user_tables`, `pg_stat_user_indexes`, `ANALYZE` | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | PostgreSQL 18's columns and types; one row per user table and materialized view (and per index), `relid` joins `pg_class.oid`, follows create / drop / rename / schema moves, restored with snapshots. `n_live_tup` is the exact row count, immediately; `ANALYZE` validates its targets (`42P01`, `42703`, `42701`, `42601`) and records `analyze_count` / `last_analyze` from the database clock. Not tracked (read zero / NULL): scans, tuples inserted / updated / deleted, dead tuples, vacuum; `idx_scan` counts only the unique-key lookups made for `SELECT`. `VACUUM ANALYZE` does not count. Temporary tables are listed under the schema they were created in, not `pg_temp` (divergence `pg-stat-counters-immediate`) (`tests/contract/catalogs/table-statistics.test.ts`) |
| Triggers (row-level, LANGUAGE sql-expressible) | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | Creation-order firing, `UPDATE OF` ignored, no INSTEAD OF (documented) |
| CREATE FUNCTION LANGUAGE sql / plpgsql-lite | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | Scalar + set-returning; plpgsql subset: DECLARE, EXCEPTION WHEN others, CASE, FOR-IN-SELECT, RETURN NEXT |
| Text search (tsvector / tsquery / @@ / ts_rank) | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | `simple`-style config; no ispell/synonym dictionaries |
| `CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto` / `digest()` | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | `digest(bytea, text)` and `digest(text, text)` for md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512. `crypt`, `hmac`, `gen_salt`, and PGP functions are not installed. OpenSSL-only names (sha3, blake2, ripemd160, sm3) are not available. Extensions other than `pgcrypto` and `pg_trgm` still fail loud (`0A000`) |
| `pg_available_extensions`, `pg_available_extension_versions`, `pg_extension` | VERIFIED | List exactly what `CREATE EXTENSION` can install here: `pgcrypto` (1.3, 1.4), `pg_trgm` (1.3 to 1.6) and the built-in `plpgsql` (1.0), with `installed_version`, schema and version following `CREATE` / `DROP EXTENSION`, rollback and snapshots. A stock PostgreSQL server lists every contrib module it ships; those are absent here (zero rows, and `CREATE EXTENSION` is `0A000`). An older version installs the same partial function set as the default one. `DROP EXTENSION` reports dependents (`2BP01`) and `CASCADE` removes dependent defaults, generated columns, CHECK constraints, views and indexes; `DROP EXTENSION plpgsql` and `ALTER EXTENSION` fail loud (`0A000`) (`tests/contract/extensions/catalogs.test.ts`) |
| `CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm` | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | `similarity(text, text)`, `<%` at the default word-similarity threshold 0.6, and a single-column `gin_trgm_ops` index on `text` or `varchar`. `gist_trgm_ops`, multicolumn `gin_trgm_ops`, and non-default thresholds are not installed. |
| COPY FROM/TO (text, csv) | VERIFIED | Via `copyFrom` API hook / rows out |
| PREPARE / EXECUTE / DEALLOCATE, SET / SHOW / RESET | VERIFIED | GUC subset, including PostgreSQL dump and migration-client preambles |
| Transactions / savepoints | VERIFIED | No `25P02` aborted state (documented divergence) |
| Collation / ordering | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | `C` semantics pinned; locale/ICU out of scope |
| Regex (`~`, `~*`, POSIX functions) | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | JS regex flavor mapped to POSIX ERE; documented edges |
| EXPLAIN | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | Stub plan shapes |
| MERGE / CALL / cursors / LISTEN / full PL/pgSQL | UNSUPPORTED | Fail loud `0A000`, registered |
| Roles / GRANT / VACUUM / LOCK | NOT APPLICABLE | Parsed no-ops where harmless |
| Wire protocol / multi-session concurrency | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | `READ COMMITTED` workspaces; `FOR UPDATE`, `NOWAIT`, `SKIP LOCKED`, and deadlock detection; per-connection settings and startup `options` / run-time parameters |
| On-disk PostgreSQL format | NOT APPLICABLE | PGMM snapshots are the persistence format, also for the wire server's opt-in durable mode (snapshot persistence, not WAL) |

## How to verify

```bash
bun run test:postgres-compat # requirements + gate + contract/fuzz/harness
bun run inventory            # oracle pg_proc/pg_operator inventory
bun run requirements         # refresh PostgreSQL 18 requirements + coverage
bun run scenarios            # catalog + smoke ratchet
bun run build                # ESM browser build
```

Do not treat isolated unit tests of internal modules as proof of PostgreSQL compatibility. The differential suite is authoritative for SQL behavior; `test:postgres-compat` is the release gate.

**Parity claim:** Verified against **PostgreSQL 18.3** (PGlite). Features marked **VERIFIED** are oracle-proven. **PARTIALLY VERIFIED** rows must not be marketed as complete. **NOT APPLICABLE** is the only allowed permanent omission from the SQL drop-in claim.
