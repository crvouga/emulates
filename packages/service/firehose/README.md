# @crvouga/mockingbird-service-firehose

> Local emulators. Real API contracts. Part of [Mockingbird](https://github.com/crvouga/mockingbird).

Stateful local emulator of Amazon Data Firehose. ESM; Node 22+ or Bun 1.2+.

## Usage

```ts
import { createServer } from "@crvouga/mockingbird-service-firehose/server"
const emulator = await createServer()
// AWS SDK: endpoint: emulator.url, region: "us-east-1", fixture credentials.
// Await emulator.close() after the test.
```

State lives in SQLite collections and participates in the shared runtime's namespace isolation,
reset, timeline, clock, journal, metrics and fault controls. No AWS account is needed.

Implemented AWS operations: `CreateDeliveryStream`, `DeleteDeliveryStream`, `ListDeliveryStreams`, `DescribeDeliveryStream`, `PutRecord`, `PutRecordBatch`, `UpdateDestination`, `TagDeliveryStream`, `UntagDeliveryStream`, `ListTagsForDeliveryStream`.

Operations outside this list fail explicitly. This package emulates API state, not AWS infrastructure,
production quotas, billing, IAM enforcement, or provider consoles. Service-specific omissions and
oracle evidence are recorded in [the AWS coverage ledger](../../../docs/AWS_COVERAGE.md).

Run `bun run parity` with LocalStack on `http://127.0.0.1:4566`; an unavailable oracle fails the run.
No LocalStack run is recorded for this integration. The parity command is a bounded read-only SDK envelope probe, not proof of full vendor equivalence.

## Install

```sh
bun add @crvouga/mockingbird-service-firehose
```

## API

- `FirehoseAPI(options?)`: low-level AWS transport instance with `fetch` and `reset`.

- `createRuntime(options?)`: in-process Fetch API and shared state controls.
- `createServer(options?)` from the `/server` entry: HTTP listener with `url`, `runtime`, and `close()`.
- `document`, `operationIds`, and `supportedOperationIds`: generated transport contract metadata.
