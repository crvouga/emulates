WIP WHOOP v2 emulator for synthetic workout, sleep, recovery and cycle synchronization.

## Install

`bun add @emulators/whoop`

## Usage

```ts
import { createRuntime } from "@emulators/whoop"
const runtime = createRuntime()
const response = await runtime.fetch(new Request("http://whoop.test/developer/v2/activity/workout", {
  headers: { authorization: "Bearer mock_whoop_token" },
}))
```

Run `emulators-whoop serve --port 12129`. Inject the local origin plus `/developer` as the consumer API base, and the origin alone as OAuth base. Consumer endpoint wiring is separate from this emulator.

## Routes and state

POST `/oauth/oauth2/token` accepts form-encoded authorization-code or refresh-token grants with client credentials. Seed `clients`, `codes`, and `grants` via options or admin state. Default emulator client: `mock_client` / `mock_client_secret`; default bearer `mock_whoop_token` and refresh `mock_whoop_refresh`. The default grant has all four read scopes and `offline`. Codes bind client, optional redirect and optional S256 PKCE challenge. Codes are single-use, including concurrent exchanges. New tokens expire after 3600 seconds (`tokenTtlSeconds` is configurable). Refresh invalidates both old access and refresh tokens, keeps the same user/scopes, and issues a refresh token only for an offline grant.

GET `/developer/v2/activity/workout`, `/developer/v2/activity/sleep`, `/developer/v2/recovery`, `/developer/v2/cycle` return `{records,next_token}`. `limit` defaults to 10, maximum 25; `nextToken` continues pages. Results sort newest start first; `start` includes equal timestamps, `end` excludes equal starts and defaults to emulator now. The collection time-window implementation uses start timestamps, including activities spanning the end instant. Scope names are `read:workout`, `read:sleep`, `read:recovery`, `read:cycles`.

Seed `records: [{key,userId,collection,data}]`; `data` is a synthetic provider-shaped record. **Recovery has `cycle_id` and `sleep_id`, not `id`, `start`, or `end`**: seed a matching sleep record to supply its time window. This corrects the issue's generic recovery field list using the official schema. Missing related-sleep fixtures are excluded. Cycle ids remain numbers; workout/sleep ids remain UUIDs. Metrics and score states are passed through, preserving null or absent metrics. Distinct storage keys can model duplicate vendor records. Cursor internals are local stand-ins; consumers must retain the same query while paginating.

## Test controls

Standard relocatable `/__admin` health/state/reset/clock/journal/Timeline/fault routes. State collections contain only synthetic fixtures. Header namespaces, `/__admin/ns/<name>` paths and bearer-credential mappings isolate state. Journals record metadata, not OAuth or health bodies. Presets `unauthorized`, `rate_limited`, `server_error`, `connection_drop` support deterministic failures; generic faults add latency. Preset error bodies are scripted local fixtures, not claims of exact quota/error wording. No webhooks are required.

## Oracle and tests

Derived from the official [OpenAPI](https://api.prod.whoop.com/developer/doc/openapi.json), [OAuth reference](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/), and [refresh example](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/tutorials/refresh-token-javascript/). The contract retains the official collection response schemas. Authorized live data and OAuth success were not probed; no live credentials used.

`bun test` runs acceptance, all-operation self-parity and divergence detection. `bun scripts/python-smoke.ts` uses `uv` to run actual requests 2.32.5 and httpx 0.28.1 against local HTTP. It is not the private consumer itself. `bun run parity` requires `WHOOP_ACCESS_TOKEN` and performs a safe collection-envelope probe without printing health data.

## Deliberately not modelled

No real users, device pairing, sensors, consent UI, hardware SDK, webhook delivery, profile/body measurements, partner APIs or scoring computation. No cursor-format parity, real quota enforcement, concurrent refresh grace period or private-client integration claim. Partial synthetic records can be seeded deliberately; validate production fixtures against the supplied official schemas. Recovery relies on matching synthetic sleep fixtures.

## API

Root runtime exports: `WhoopAPI`, `WHOOP_NAMESPACE`, `COLLECTION_SCOPES`, `createRuntime`, `WHOOP_PRESETS`, `document`, `operationIds`, `supportedOperationIds`. Types: `WhoopAPIOptions`, `Grant`, `OAuthCode`, `Client`, `DataRecord`, `CollectionName`, `WhoopRuntimeOptions`, `WhoopRuntime`, `OperationId`, `SupportedOperationId`.

`/server`: `createServer`, `serveTarget`, `DEFAULT_PORT`; types `WhoopServerOptions`, `WhoopServer`.
