# @crvouga/mockingbird-service-stripe

> Familiar calls. Faithful echoes. Part of [Mockingbird](https://github.com/crvouga/mockingbird).

Stateful, in-process mock of the [Stripe API](https://docs.stripe.com/api) for test suites: accounts
chosen by API key, customers and balances, payment methods, payment and setup intents, charges,
refunds, disputes, checkout (with a hosted page and a Stripe.js stand-in), the customer portal
(configurations, sessions and the hosted portal page), invoices, subscriptions that renew, pause,
resume and cancel as the clock moves, subscription schedules, coupons, promotion codes, products,
prices, test clocks, webhook endpoints, the balance ledger and the event log — with signed webhooks
fanned out to every matching endpoint. Responses are rendered at the caller's `Stripe-Version`
(`2024-06-20`, `2025-02-24.acacia`, or the vendored latest), and the whole surface is verified by
differential property tests against Stripe test mode.

## Install

```bash
npm install -D @crvouga/mockingbird-service-stripe
```

ESM only. Requires Node >= 22 or Bun >= 1.2. No native dependencies: state lives in an in-memory
SQLite engine (pure TypeScript, bundled in).

## Usage

```bash
npx mockingbird-stripe serve                  # http://127.0.0.1:12111
npx mockingbird-stripe serve --accounts accounts.json --admin-key local-admin
npx mockingbird-stripe serve --config mockingbird.json   # every service in one process
```

```js
import Stripe from "stripe"
import { createServer } from "@crvouga/mockingbird-service-stripe/server"

const server = await createServer({
  accounts: [
    // Legacy STRIPE_API_KEY, STRIPE_MSO_API_KEY and the EMR key all act as MSO and share state.
    { id: "acct_mso", keys: ["sk_test_legacy", "sk_test_mso", "sk_test_emr", "pk_test_mso"], corpus: true },
    { id: "acct_pc", keys: ["sk_test_pc"] },
    { id: "acct_pp", keys: ["sk_test_pp"], apiVersion: "2025-02-24.acacia" },
  ],
})
const url = new URL(server.url)
const stripe = new Stripe("sk_test_mso", {
  apiVersion: "2024-06-20",
  host: url.hostname,
  port: Number(url.port),
  protocol: "http",
})
const customer = await stripe.customers.create({ email: "qa@example.com" })
await stripe.paymentMethods.attach("pm_card_visa", { customer: customer.id }) // a new pm_ id
await server.close()
```

Or over raw HTTP, the way any Stripe client talks to it:

```ts
import { createServer } from "@crvouga/mockingbird-service-stripe/server"

const server = await createServer()
const response = await fetch(`${server.url}/v1/customers`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    authorization: "Bearer sk_test_mso",
    "content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
  },
  body: new URLSearchParams({ email: "qa@example.com" }),
})
const customer = (await response.json()) as { id: string; email: string }
await server.close()
```

### Pointing the app at it

stripe-node accepts `host`, `port` and `protocol`; route every `new Stripe(...)` through one options
factory reading `STRIPE_API_HOST` / `STRIPE_API_PORT` / `STRIPE_API_PROTOCOL` (the catalog's G-S1),
and give raw `fetch('https://api.stripe.com…')` call sites the same base URL. Keys must look like
test keys (`sk_test_…`, `rk_test_…`; `pk_test_…` for the Stripe.js stand-in). Point the browser at
the mock's `GET /v3` instead of `https://js.stripe.com/v3` (G-S3); `session.url` already points at
the mock's hosted page.

### Accounts and namespaces

State is partitioned by **account**, and the account is chosen by API key:

- `PUT /__admin/accounts {"accounts": [{id, keys, apiVersion?, webhookSecrets?, corpus?, displayName?, billing?}]}`
  (also `createRuntime({accounts})` / `serve --accounts <json|file>`). Every key listed on an
  account acts as it. Any other test key is an account of its own (`accountOfKey(key)`), so an MSO
  key reading a PC object gets Stripe's exact `404 resource_missing` (`No such payment_intent: 'pi_…'`).
- `apiVersion` is the account's default version (requests without `Stripe-Version`) and the version
  its webhook payloads render at (default `2024-06-20`, what every backend receiver of ours pins).
- `webhookSecrets: {"<receiver url>": "whsec_…"}` delivers every event of the account there.
- `corpus: true` seeds the recorded catalog (below).
- `billing: {retries: {scheduleDays?, afterAllFail?}}` sets the account's failed-renewal retries
  (see Lifecycles and the clock); unset fields use `createRuntime({lifecycle: {paymentRetries}})`.

**Namespaces** isolate parallel workers; each namespace has its own copy of every account. Carriers:
the `x-mockingbird-namespace` header, the `/__admin/ns/<namespace>/…` path prefix, or **by API key**:
`PUT /__admin/credentials {"credentials": {"sk_test_worker1": "w1"}}` (stripe-node cannot add
headers). Hosted-page URLs carry the `/__admin/ns/<namespace>` prefix so the browser lands in the same one.

### API versions

`Stripe-Version` picks the shape. `2024-06-20` (and anything before 2024-09-30) returns
`invoice.discount` (with the coupon embedded), `invoice.charge` / `payment_intent` / `subscription` /
`paid` / `subscription_details`, `subscription.current_period_*` and `subscription.discount`, and
invoice lines with `price` objects; `2025-02-24.acacia` adds `total_pretax_credit_amounts`;
2025-03-31.basil and later (the vendored latest) drop those and use `parent`, `pricing`,
`discount.source` and item-level periods; at basil `charge.invoice` and `payment_intent.invoice` are gone
too, and an invoice's payments are `invoice_payment` objects (`inpay_…`): `expand[]=payments` on an
invoice (or `latest_invoice.payments` on a subscription), `GET /v1/invoice_payments` (filter by
`invoice`, `payment[type]=payment_intent&payment[payment_intent]`, `status`, `created`) and
`GET /v1/invoice_payments/{id}`. One default payment per invoice that has a PaymentIntent, derived from
the invoice; a $0 invoice has none, and payment records are not modelled. `charge.refunds` appears only with `expand[]=refunds` at
every one of these versions. `GET /v1/invoices/upcoming` answers at the older versions and returns
Stripe's "deprecated" 404 at basil and later. Expansion is generic (any path through ids the mock
holds, ancestors included); Stripe's own rules are enforced: a non-expandable first segment is
`This property cannot be expanded (metadata).` and more than four levels is
`property_expansion_max_depth` (verified against test mode at all three versions).

### Webhooks

Every state change records an event in the account's log (`GET /v1/events`, filterable by
`types[]` and `created`) and publishes it through the shared webhook hub, signed
`Stripe-Signature: t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex HMAC-SHA256(secret, "t.body")>` over the exact bytes —
`stripe.webhooks.constructEvent` verifies them.

- Endpoints: `PUT /__admin/webhook-endpoints [{account, url, secret, enabledEvents: ["*"|…]}]`
  (`account` is an account id or any of its keys; omit it to receive every account),
  `serve --webhook-url/--webhook-secret`, accounts' `webhookSecrets`, and endpoints created through
  `POST /v1/webhook_endpoints` (signed with the `whsec_` returned at creation). One event fans out to
  every matching endpoint, as on Stripe. Retries follow the hub's schedule.
- `t` is the wall clock, unless the runtime's `clock` is injected (`createRuntime({ clock })`):
  then `t`, retries and the attempt timeout run on that clock, so a virtual-time suite verifies with
  `constructEventAsync(body, sig, secret, tolerance, undefined, clock.now())` and sees a retry when it
  advances the clock (`runtime.clock.advance`, or `runtime.tick()` after moving its own clock).
  `webhooks: { now, schedule, cancel, id }` override the hub's sources directly.
- `GET /__admin/webhooks`, `/webhooks/events`, `POST /__admin/webhooks/:id/replay`, `/webhooks/flush`.
- Delivery faults: presets `webhook_duplicate` (same event id twice — our receiver's in-flight
  dedupe answers 500), `webhook_reorder` (the next two swapped), `webhook_drop` (never delivered,
  still in `GET /v1/events` for the replay worker).
- Metadata is copied verbatim, so the PC route's quarantine rule (`metadata.intent ∈ {pc_order,
  kb_membership, shop_purchase, stripe_membership}` or `source=supplement` + `billingInvoiceId`)
  only fires for sessions that would trip it on Stripe.

Events emitted: `customer.*`, `payment_method.attached|detached|updated`,
`payment_intent.created|succeeded|payment_failed|canceled|requires_action|amount_capturable_updated`,
`charge.succeeded|failed|captured|refunded|dispute.created`, `setup_intent.created|succeeded|setup_failed|canceled|requires_action`,
`checkout.session.completed|expired|async_payment_succeeded`,
`invoice.created|finalized|updated|paid|payment_succeeded|payment_failed|voided|deleted|upcoming`,
`invoiceitem.created`, `customer.subscription.created|updated|deleted` (with
`data.previous_attributes`), `subscription_schedule.*`, `refund.created|updated|failed`,
`product.*`, `price.*` (with `previous_attributes`), `coupon.*`, `promotion_code.*`,
`test_helpers.test_clock.*`.

### Lifecycles and the clock

`POST /__admin/clock {"advance": "32d"}` (or `set`) moves the mock clock and immediately runs every
clock-driven lifecycle, so their webhooks fire at once; the served mock also ticks every second.

- **Renewals**: past `current_period_end` a subscription cycles — a `subscription_cycle` invoice is
  finalized and charged off-session to the default payment method, then `invoice.paid` +
  `customer.subscription.updated` (`previous_attributes.current_period_end`), or
  `invoice.payment_failed` and `past_due`. Trials end into a cycle; `cancel_at_period_end` cancels
  (`customer.subscription.deleted`). `invoice.upcoming` fires 3 days before renewal and
  `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` 3 days before a trial ends (once per trial).
- **Trials without a card**: `trial_settings[end_behavior][missing_payment_method]` decides what a
  trial ending with no default payment method does — `create_invoice` (the default) invoices and
  goes `past_due`, `cancel` cancels at the trial's end, `pause` sets status `paused`
  (`customer.subscription.paused`) until `POST /v1/subscriptions/:id/resume`:
  `billing_cycle_anchor=now` (default) starts a new period with a `subscription_update` invoice
  (paid → `active`, failed → `past_due`); `unchanged` keeps the anchor and prorates the rest of the
  period per `proration_behavior` (and `proration_date`). Both emit `customer.subscription.resumed`.
- **Paused collection**: `pause_collection[behavior]` keeps periods moving while renewal invoices are
  voided (`void`), marked `uncollectible` (`mark_uncollectible`, `invoice.marked_uncollectible`) or
  left as drafts (`keep_as_draft`), never charged; the status holds. `pause_collection[resumes_at]`
  lifts the pause on its own before the renewal it precedes; `pause_collection=""` lifts it now.
- **Payment retries**: a declined renewal (`charge_automatically`) leaves the invoice `open` with
  `attempt_count: 1` and `next_payment_attempt`, and the subscription `past_due`. Each retry
  `scheduleDays` after the first failure (default `[3, 5, 7]`, Stripe's classic "3 retries over
  1 week") charges again when the clock reaches it: a decline bumps `attempt_count`, emits
  `invoice.payment_failed` and moves `next_payment_attempt`; a working default payment method pays
  the invoice (`invoice.paid`) and the subscription is `active` again
  (`customer.subscription.updated`). After the last retry `next_payment_attempt` is `null` and
  `afterAllFail` applies: `cancel` (the default: `canceled`, `cancellation_details.reason:
  payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.deleted`), `unpaid` (`customer.subscription.updated`) or
  `past_due` (nothing changes). An empty schedule applies it at the first failure. The schedule is
  fixed, not Stripe's ML-timed Smart Retries; set it per account (`billing.retries`, also
  `PUT /__admin/accounts`) or for the runtime (`lifecycle.paymentRetries`). Dunning emails are not sent.
- `incomplete` subscriptions become `incomplete_expired` after 23 h (their invoice is voided).
- Checkout Sessions expire at `expires_at` (`checkout.session.expired`).
- Schedule phases advance; the last one releases or cancels per `end_behavior`.
- **Test clocks**: customers created with `test_clock` live on the clock's time;
  `POST /v1/test_helpers/test_clocks/:id/advance` runs their lifecycles and the clock reads `ready`
  on the next retrieve.
- `POST /__admin/tick` runs the lifecycle without moving the clock.

Payment behaviour: `payment_behavior` omitted (`allow_incomplete`) charges the default payment method
now and returns `incomplete` on a decline; `error_if_incomplete` fails the call with the 402;
`default_incomplete` leaves the first invoice's PaymentIntent (with its `client_secret`) for the
customer, and paying it through Stripe.js activates the subscription. `trial_end`,
`backdate_start_date` + `billing_cycle_anchor` + `proration_behavior=none` (a $0 first invoice),
item updates with `always_invoice` (billed now) or `create_prorations` (next invoice), and
discounts with stable `di_` ids (`discounts=""` clears) are modelled. An item update to a price with
a different billing period (say monthly → yearly, through the API or the portal's **Update plan**)
resets `billing_cycle_anchor` to now, starts a new period and invoices it at once (less a
proration credit for the unused time unless `proration_behavior=none`); a trialing subscription
keeps its trial end instead. Items must be active recurring prices sharing one currency and
interval. `DELETE /v1/subscriptions/:id` takes
`cancellation_details[comment|feedback]`, `prorate` (a credit for the unused time as a pending
proration) and `invoice_now` (a final invoice; a net credit lands on the customer balance), in the
query string (as stripe-node sends them) or the body. A $0 invoice is `paid` on
finalize; a customer credit balance is applied at finalize; `void` works only on open invoices
(`You can only pass in open invoices. This invoice isn't open.`).

### Hosted Checkout page and Stripe.js

- `GET /c/pay/:sessionId` — the page `session.url` points to, laid out like Stripe's hosted
  Checkout (order summary beside the payment form, stacked on narrow screens): card number,
  expiry, CVC, ZIP and Pay/Cancel with `data-testid`s `stripe-mock-card`, `stripe-mock-exp`,
  `stripe-mock-cvc`, `stripe-mock-zip`, `stripe-mock-pay`, `stripe-mock-cancel` (a decline shows
  `stripe-mock-error`), plus optional email, cardholder name and country. A **Test cards** panel
  has one button per test card number (`stripe-mock-test-card`, `data-test-card="<number>"`):
  succeeding brands, declines (generic, insufficient funds, expired, attach-then-fail), 3D Secure
  and dispute. Each button fills every field, and with “Pay immediately after filling” ticked it
  submits the form too. Pay completes the session (creating the customer, the PaymentIntent with
  `payment_intent_data.metadata`, the Subscription with `subscription_data` — metadata,
  description, trial and `trial_settings` — or the SetupIntent), emits `checkout.session.completed`
  and 302s to `success_url` with `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` substituted raw and `%7B…%7D`-encoded;
  Cancel 302s to `cancel_url`. The page authenticates 3-D Secure cards in place in every mode, and
  checks what was typed the way the Payment Element does (expiry in the past, incomplete CVC,
  invalid email); a decline leaves the session open (in subscription and setup mode it creates no
  customer; in payment mode it records the failed PaymentIntent and charge, as Stripe does). The email and name
  typed become the new customer's and `customer_details`; `customer_email` pre-fills the email.
- Subscription mode bills one-time lines once, on the first invoice, and `price_data` lines (with
  or without `recurring`) create inline prices (and `product_data` products), so every line — and
  the subscription — references a real price id. With `payment_method_collection=if_required` a
  free trial shows no card fields (`stripe-mock-no-card`) and starts without a payment method.
- `allow_promotion_codes=true` adds a promotion code field to the summary
  (`stripe-mock-promotion-code`, `-apply`, `-remove`; a refusal shows
  `stripe-mock-promotion-error` with Checkout's "This code is invalid."). Codes are
  case-insensitive and checked for being active, unexpired, under their limits, for this customer,
  first-time and minimum-amount restrictions, and applicable products; the session re-prices.
- Creation is validated like Stripe: `customer` with `customer_email`, a recurring price in
  `payment` mode, `allow_promotion_codes` with `discounts`, `subscription_data` outside
  subscription mode, `payment_intent_data` outside payment mode, `customer_creation` outside
  payment mode, inactive prices, mixed currencies, quantities below 1, `trial_end` under 48 h.
- `POST /__admin/checkout/sessions/:id/complete {"card": "4242…"}` does the same without a browser;
  `…/expire` and `…/async_payment_succeeded` too.
- `GET /v3` — the Stripe.js stand-in: `Stripe(pk)`, `elements()` → combined `create("payment"|"card")`
  or split `create("cardNumber"|"cardExpiry"|"cardCvc")` inputs. Split inputs share card data
  within their `Elements` group, add no visible labels, and the combined card honors
  `hidePostalCode`. Card inputs format number/expiry/CVC values, report field-level `empty`,
  `complete`, `brand`, and validation errors through change events, and refuse tokenization until
  all required split or combined values are valid. It also provides
  `confirmPayment`, `confirmSetup`, `confirmCardPayment`, `confirmCardSetup`,
  `retrievePaymentIntent`, `retrieveSetupIntent`, `createPaymentMethod`, `handleCardAction`. It calls
  `POST /v1/{payment,setup}_intents/:id/confirm` with the publishable key and `client_secret` (the
  requests UI suites already wait for); 3-D Secure cards are authenticated in place.

A publishable key may only confirm or read an intent whose `client_secret` it presents, and create
payment methods; anything else is Stripe's 401.

### Customer portal

`POST /v1/billing_portal/sessions` returns a `url` on the mock (`/p/session/:id`, in place of
billing.stripe.com) where the customer manages their billing, as the session's configuration allows:

- **Configurations**: `POST|GET /v1/billing_portal/configurations[/:id]`
  (`billing_portal.configuration.created|updated`). Each account has a default configuration, as if
  saved in the dashboard: every feature on, cancellation at period end with a reason, plan and
  quantity changes with `create_prorations` across every active product with active recurring
  prices. API-created configurations start with every feature off; `products[].prices` must be
  recurring prices of that product; the default cannot be deactivated.
- **Sessions** check the customer, an active configuration, and `flow_data`: the subscription must
  be the customer's and manageable, the feature enabled, `subscription_update_confirm` prices
  offered, a retention coupon real (`billing_portal.session.created`). `return_url` falls back to
  `default_return_url`.
- **The page** (`data-testid="stripe-mock-portal"`, `data-view`): current subscriptions with their
  status (trial end, cancels on, past due, paused, payments paused); **Cancel plan** (reason and
  comment → `cancellation_details`; at period end, or immediately with the configured proration);
  **Renew plan** for a subscription set to cancel; **Update plan** (price and quantity within the
  configured bounds, a confirmation step showing the proration, then the configured
  `proration_behavior`; `trial_update_behavior=end_trial` ends a trial); payment methods (**Add**
  through a SetupIntent, which becomes the customer's and each subscription's default; **Make
  default**; **Delete** a non-default card); billing information (the configured `allowed_updates`,
  `customer.updated` with `previous_attributes`); invoice history with **Pay** for open invoices.
  Repeated choices carry a per-option `data-testid` on the wrapping `<label class="option">`
  (tapping it checks the radio), so a test-id-only driver can pick one: each plan is
  `stripe-mock-portal-price-option-<price lookup_key, else price id>` and each cancellation reason
  is `stripe-mock-portal-reason-<reason>` (e.g. `…-too_expensive`). The generic
  `stripe-mock-portal-price-option` and `stripe-mock-portal-reason` ids stay on the radios.
- **Deep links** open on the flow's page — cancel (with a retention offer to accept), update, update
  confirmation, payment method, billing details — and on completion honour `after_completion`:
  `redirect` (302), `hosted_confirmation` (its `custom_message`) or the homepage. Every action
  runs the same code as the API call it stands for, so the webhooks match.

Like Stripe's portal, it has no pause control: pausing is `pause_collection` or
`trial_settings` + `/resume` through the API, and the portal shows a paused subscription as such.

### Test values

- Payment methods: `pm_card_visa`, `pm_card_mastercard`, `pm_card_amex`, `pm_card_discover`,
  `pm_card_visa_debit`, `pm_card_chargeDeclined`, `pm_card_chargeDeclinedInsufficientFunds`,
  `pm_card_chargeDeclinedExpiredCard`, `pm_card_chargeCustomerFail`,
  `pm_card_authenticationRequired`, `pm_card_threeDSecure2Required`, `pm_card_createDispute` —
  each use clones a new `pm_`.
- Tokens: `tok_visa`, `tok_chargeCustomerFail` (attaches, then every charge declines),
  `tok_chargeDeclinedInsufficientFunds`, `tok_chargeDeclinedExpiredCard`, `tok_createDispute`, …
- Card numbers (page, Stripe.js): `4242424242424242` succeeds, `4000000000000002` declines,
  `4000000000009995` insufficient funds, `4000002500003155` 3-D Secure, `4000051230000072` the HSA
  card (`funding: prepaid`, `issuer: OPTUM BANK`, what our HSA/FSA detection matches).
- Off-session declines answer 402 `card_error` with `charge`, `decline_code`, `advice_code`,
  `payment_method` and the failed `payment_intent` embedded, as Stripe does.
- Client secrets are `pi_<id>_secret_<x>` / `seti_<id>_secret_<x>`.

### Idempotency

POSTs with `Idempotency-Key` go through the shared `IdempotencyStore`, scoped per account: a
replay returns the stored response byte for byte (with `idempotent-replayed: true`); the same key
with different parameters is 400 `idempotency_error`; a concurrent request on an in-flight key is
409 `idempotency_key_in_use`, with Stripe's wording.

### Fault presets

`POST /__admin/faults {"preset": "<name>", "count"?: n}`: `card_declined`, `insufficient_funds`,
`expired_card`, `authentication_required` (the next charge attempt declines), `rate_limited` (429
`rate_limit`), `api_error` (500 `api_error`), `permission_error` (403), `connection_drop`,
`idempotency_in_flight` (500 ms processing, so a concurrent retry gets 409), `search_lag` (search
hides objects younger than 60 s — search is consistent otherwise), `webhook_duplicate`,
`webhook_reorder`, `webhook_drop`.

### Admin routes (beyond the standard contract)

`GET|PUT /__admin/accounts`, `PUT /__admin/webhook-endpoints`, `PUT /__admin/refunds/:id
{status, failure_reason}` (emits `refund.failed` / `refund.updated`), `POST /__admin/disputes
{payment_intent|charge, reason?, amount?}` (emits `charge.dispute.created`),
`POST /__admin/checkout/sessions/:id/complete|expire|async_payment_succeeded`,
`POST /__admin/setup_intents/:id/succeed`, `GET /__admin/charges/:id`, `POST /__admin/tick`. The
standard ones (`/__admin/health`, reset, snapshots, clock, faults, metrics, `GET /__admin/requests`,
credentials, webhooks) come from the shared runtime. The journal records operation, status and ids
only — never bodies, card numbers or emails.

### Corpus

`ACME_CORPUS` is the recorded test-mode catalog our seeded fixtures point at (reference-data
products and prices, catalog plans, shop fixtures, QA snapshots such as `prod_SNj3rQYHrHNS0H` /
`price_1StxtjGBBGmxLhdL8PzNSEgX`, and runbook coupons and promotion codes; 144 products, 172
prices). Accounts with `corpus: true` answer those ids byte for byte; customers, intents and
subscriptions are never recorded. The membership lookup keys our env expects
(`membership_<tier>_<interval>`, e.g. `membership_plus_annually`) are attached to the matching
recorded prices (listed in `synthesizedLookupKeys`). Pass your own with `createRuntime({corpus})`.

## API

`StripeAPI` is the engine; `createRuntime` wraps it in the service contract. From
`@crvouga/mockingbird-service-stripe`:

| Export | Description |

Options: `accounts`, `webhooks {endpoints, retryDelaysMs, fetch}`, `corpus`, `publicUrl`, `webhookApiVersion`, `lifecycle`, `tickMs`, `sqlite`, `clock`, `seed`, `adminKey`, `onLog`, `onWebhook`. The runtime adds `webhooks`, `accounts`, `tick()`, `stop()`. |
| `StripeAPI` | Class; `new StripeAPI(options?)` implements `fetch(request)`. Members: `reset()`, `tick(force?)`, `webhookEvents(account?)`, `webhookDeliveryAttempts(account?)`, `apiWebhookEndpoints()`, `accountIds()`, `scopeFor(account)`, `importStateFrom(source)`, `accounts`, `app`, `sqlite`. |
| `STRIPE_PRESETS` | The named fault presets above. |
| `AccountDirectory` | Keys → accounts (`configure`, `accountFor`, `config`, `list`, `resolve`). |
| `DEFAULT_WEBHOOK_API_VERSION` | `"2024-06-20"`. |
| `accountOfKey` | `(key) => string` — the account id of an unconfigured key. |

| `STRIPE_NAMESPACE` | `"stripe"` — SQLite namespace of every record. |
| `document` | The vendored OpenAPI document (Mockingbird subset). |
| `operationIds` | Every `operationId` in `document`. |
| `supportedOperationIds` | The ones the mock implements. |
| `QA_SURFACE_OPS` | Operations the parity walks cover (supported, minus the browser pages). |
| `QA_METADATA` | Pinned metadata values the parity walks send. |
| `QA_AMOUNTS` | Pinned amounts in cents. |
| `QA_CUSTOMER` | Pinned customer `email`, `name`, `phone`. |

| `reshapeQaCommand` | Parity-walk hook pinning sampled commands onto those values. |

From `@crvouga/mockingbird-service-stripe/server` (Node): `createServer(options?)` (runtime options
plus `port`, `host`; resolves `{url, port, runtime, close}`), `serveTarget` (the `serve` wiring:
`--accounts`, `--webhook-url`, `--webhook-secret`, `--public-url`) and `DEFAULT_PORT` (`12111`).

## Deliberately not modelled

- **Stripe.js internals**: the stand-in covers the calls our UI makes; Payment Element wallets,
  Link, `paymentRequest` (it reports no wallet) and Elements styling are not modelled. Native
  PaymentSheet cannot be redirected (member-app native keeps its fake provider).
- **Connect** (`Stripe-Account`, application fees, transfers), tax, shipping, Radar, mandates,
  meters, quotes, credit notes, payouts, and non-card payment methods (bank debits, wallets).
- **Billing cycle anchor resets** other than a price change to a different billing period through
  `POST /v1/subscriptions/:id`: an explicit `billing_cycle_anchor=now|unchanged` on update is ignored,
  and the `/v1/subscription_items` endpoints change prices without resetting the period.
- **Proration arithmetic** is day-fraction approximate (Stripe prorates to the second);
  `auto_advance` drafts are not finalized an hour later.
- **Customer portal extras**: the login page (`login_page.url` is not served), `schedule_at_period_end`
  downgrades, multi-item subscription updates, locales,
  and payment method configurations. Portal sessions do not expire.
- **Multi-currency prices** store, merge (on update) and return `currency_options` when expanded,
  and a Checkout Session `currency` charges a payment-mode line in that option. Per-option
  `tiers` and `custom_unit_amount`, and subscription-mode sessions in a non-default currency, are
  refused with a 400; subscriptions and invoices always bill in the price's own currency.
- **Webhook endpoint `api_version`**: payloads render at the account's version, not per endpoint.
- **Live keys** (`sk_live_…`) are refused with Stripe's 401: the mock is test mode only.
- Operations marked unsupported in SUPPORT.md (charge create/update, checkout session update,
  dispute evidence).
- Rate-limit, 5xx and permission bodies come from presets, worded as Stripe words them but not
  recorded from traffic.

## Development

For contributors to the mockingbird repo only; these scripts are not shipped in the npm package.

```bash
bun test                   # self-parity, acceptance (via test/consumer.ts), stripe-node drop-in, contract
bun run parity             # live differential parity against Stripe test mode (safe operations)
bun run parity -- --include-unsafe --only PostCustomers,GetCustomers
bun run client-parity      # stripe-node smoke proof with webhook signature verification
bun run vendor             # re-vendor openapi.yaml from the pinned upstream spec
```

Live parity loads `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (a `sk_test_` key) from the environment (`.env.local`,
or the repo secret via `bun run parity:remote -- stripe`) and exits 2 without one. By default it walks only safe operations and
leaves out account-global ones (account profile, lifetime balance, lingering test clocks and
webhook endpoints).
