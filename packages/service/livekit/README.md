# @crvouga/mockingbird-service-livekit

> Familiar calls. Faithful echoes. Part of [Mockingbird](https://github.com/crvouga/mockingbird).

Stateful LiveKit mock for `livekit-server-sdk`. It serves Twirp JSON room and agent-dispatch APIs, validates genuine HS256 LiveKit grants, models participant/track/data state, exposes deterministic SIP and egress controls, and emits correctly signed lifecycle webhooks.

## Install

```bash
npm install -D @crvouga/mockingbird-service-livekit
```

ESM only. Node 22+ or Bun 1.2+.

## Usage

```ts
import { createServer } from "@crvouga/mockingbird-service-livekit/server"

const mock = await createServer({
  keys: { fixture: "fixture-secret-that-is-at-least-32-chars" },
})
const health = await fetch(`${mock.url}/health`)
```

Point `RoomServiceClient` at `mock.url`. Supported RoomService calls include CreateRoom, ListRooms, DeleteRoom, UpdateRoomMetadata, ListParticipants, GetParticipant, RemoveParticipant, UpdateParticipant, MutePublishedTrack, and SendData. Room creation is idempotent by name and participant identity is unique within a room.

`AgentDispatchClient` uses the same URL and genuine `roomAdmin` JWTs for `createDispatch`, `listDispatch`, `getDispatch`, and `deleteDispatch`. Both snake_case and camelCase request fields work. A dispatch creates a missing room, starts with no assigned jobs, and preserves its agent name and opaque metadata. Lists read shared room dispatch state, with an optional dispatch-id filter; deleting a dispatch removes its membership. Deleting or expiring a room removes its dispatches. Dispatch/job timestamps are mock-clock Unix seconds encoded as protobuf JSON strings (the SDK exposes bigint values). Tests exercise the existing 2.19.1 SDK and the reporter's exact 2.19.0 over HTTP.

## Controls

- `POST /__admin/rooms/:room/participants` joins a synthetic participant.
- `DELETE /__admin/rooms/:room/participants/:identity` disconnects it.
- `POST /__admin/rooms/:room/participants/:identity/tracks` publishes a track.
- `GET /__admin/rooms/:room/participants/:identity/inbox` inspects targeted data.
- `GET /__admin/resources` and `POST /__admin/resources/:id/transition` inspect and advance SIP/egress state.
- `POST /__admin/dispatches/:id/jobs` scripts one room job with `{status?: "JS_PENDING"|"JS_RUNNING"|"JS_SUCCESS"|"JS_FAILED", workerId?, agentId?, participantIdentity?, error?}`. First assignment creates a stable job id; later calls update it and stamp its start/end/update times. The default status is running.
- Dispatches and jobs participate in namespaces, reset, snapshots, Timeline and fault recovery alongside room state.
- Fault presets include rate limiting, network loss, and webhook duplicate/reorder/drop delivery.

Webhooks cover room, participant, track, egress, and SIP transitions. Each raw body is signed by a short-lived LiveKit access token whose `sha256` claim is accepted by the official `WebhookReceiver`.

## API

- `LiveKitAPI`, `LiveKitAPIOptions`, `LiveKitEvent`: handler and event contract.
- `LiveKitRoom`, `LiveKitParticipant`, `LiveKitTrack`, `DataMessage`, `AsyncResource`, `AgentDispatch`, `AgentJob`, `JobStatus`: durable state.
- `createRuntime`, `LiveKitRuntime`, `LiveKitRuntimeOptions`: full runtime and webhook hub.
- `LIVEKIT_NAMESPACE`, `LIVEKIT_PRESETS`: constants and fault controls.
- `document`, `operationIds`, `supportedOperationIds`: generated OpenAPI metadata.
- `createServer`, `LiveKitServerOptions`, `DEFAULT_PORT`, `serveTarget` from `./server`: Node adapter and CLI integration.

## Deliberately not modelled

Real agent worker registration, job execution, publisher dispatch, restart/deployment policies, WebRTC media transport, signaling sockets, transcoding, PSTN calls, production scaling, billing, and dashboards are not modelled. The deterministic server API and lifecycle contract is the initial fidelity boundary.
