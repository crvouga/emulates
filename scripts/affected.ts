/**
 * Which workspace packages a change reaches, through the dependency graph Turborepo already holds
 * (`turbo query`: every package's transitive workspace dependencies, from the package.json
 * `dependencies`, `devDependencies` and peers). scripts/ci-plan.ts uses it to scope a pull request:
 * a package is affected when a file in it or in anything it depends on changed, so a change to
 * mock A never reaches mock B, and a change to a shared package reaches every dependent.
 *
 * Files that belong to no package (root config, scripts) are the caller's call, and `bun.lock` is
 * read here: Turborepo does not diff bun's lockfile, so `lockfileImpact` does.
