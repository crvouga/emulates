This is the installed-package index for coding agents and tooling. All relative links resolve
inside \`node_modules/${packageName}/\`; no repository checkout is needed to discover the mock's
supported surface or documented behavior.

## Capability and behavior sources

| Question | Authoritative file | What it contains |
| --- | --- | --- |
${artifactRows.map(([label, file, description]) => `| ${label} | [\`${file}\`](${file}) | ${description} |`).join("\n")}

Read these together: the contract/capability matrix says *what* is available, while the README
defines stateful behavior, lifecycle rules, test controls, and intentional oracle differences.
If prose and an executable surface disagree, report a parity mismatch instead of adding a
consumer-side workaround.

## Parity and oracle

- Declared parity surface: **${parity}**.
${tier ? `- Parity tier: **${tier}** (the repository controls when live checks run).\n` : ""}- Oracle: **${discovery.oracle.kind}**.
- Repository command: \`${discovery.oracle.command}\`.
- Evidence model: ${discovery.oracle.note}

The npm package contains evidence summaries and the exact contract, not credentials or the
repository-only parity harness. Self-parity/property and acceptance tests run in the Mockingbird
repository; live parity is an additional oracle check, not a substitute for the packaged matrix.

## Runtime introspection

${discovery.introspection.map((item) => `- \`${item}\``).join("\n")}

For HTTP services, use \`x-mockingbird-namespace\` (or the documented credential/path carrier) so
parallel tests do not share state. Admin state, journal, metrics and fault-preset endpoints are
designed for assertions and diagnosis by consuming test suites.

## Report a mismatch or missing capability

Follow the [agent reporting contract](${discovery.reporting}). Include package version,
operation/command, a minimal redacted request, actual mock result, expected oracle result or vendor
documentation, and whether the mismatch appears in the matrix. Never include keys, tokens,
customer data, prompts, PHI, card data, or unredacted recordings.

Service key: \`${service}\`.
